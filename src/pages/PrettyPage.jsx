      <h2>An Introduction</h2>
      
      <p>
      Another evening in the early spring of the northwest continues its discourse with numerous shapely people of varied postures and dispositions searching and getting lost as far as they can see. Everything is connected though rarely do they seem to notice as this certain blindness blooms sweetly between them while they conspire to retain its most whole comfortability. 
      <br /><br />
      There, shining in the faint light and nestled against the curb is a piece of litter which fell from the grip of someone on your street that was once handled and packaged to ensure enough wage to feed their families, and is now here, there rather, lying in non-sentience awaiting a street sweeper or particularly curious person willing to reinvestigate its significance. Either way it has a story that twists into endlessness like the beginnings of a spiral atop the question mark, a story that some will say has nothing to do with you. However, as we’ll attune, this is surely in denial. Everything exists with a tether, a tag, an indelible excess that slips or reaches out and latches on to you. 
      <br /><br />
      Thus, we must ask: what happens when we look again? Can we not follow at least a shred of meaning dangling in these fibers, a meaning that may grow out from the mud to you? And if there is this kind of meaning, how does it find cause to grow and die? Does this existence of meaning roll back its tricky line all the way to an original cause? Original, of course, beyond needing any cause to exist itself? And if not, then what? Thus, we must ask does meaning even cause us to see it? Or rather and most pertinently, does meaning in fact bring with it an opposition, an impractical and a-metric nature, that is cast aside at the point meaning arrives? Would it imply not-meaning? There must be something or someone else over and out of the picture that is there, un-there, without any sign at all. Thus, we must ask next: how do we get without? 
      <br /><br />
      It eventually becomes somewhat ludicrous to obsess on such minute endeavors the universe is carrying out. So you, I, we, move on and worry about other things in life like jobs and bad jokes, performance, illness, tragedy, how to leave and remember on the same saddened path, reading and riding, choking and trying new things; and meanwhile light-years closer than we may want to imagine there are ALIENS plausibly up to comparable activity living and breathing through mortgages and drugs, other-terrestrial family road trips around the planet to stare at laconic pyramids and organize one’s life; or punk-ass aliens cackling apathetically while being asked to change the subject at the alien dinner table by those more mature aliens with the house and anal retentive behavior; and prophetic aliens, there could be those too.

      Light trampolines off the moon in its mischievous wave-particle rebellion into a faint encounter with several of these sentient beings, one of whom is on a walk commiserating with the night. The litter of the matter is now elsewhere, off into the dark and beyond its preceding significance while tonight this moonlight shines upon an old cowboy hat. It stretches the former hide of a hardly heard mammal, now marinated in the rain and brow-salt of its previous host, into a certain poise. 
      <br /><br />
      “Why’s there a cowboy hat in the street, with the moonlight spotting it out just right?” Clark thought to himself as he turned the corner for the final leg of his preferred route home. The hat didn’t say a word as he reached for first contact.
      <br /><br />
      A block away at their house Nelson happens to be reveling in the wake of a serious bout with a series of baffling moments. He manages to watch the television now safely sunk into the couch after fielding this all too mysterious hand. A documentary describing the life and times of the unforgettable Woody Guthrie plays before him. It portrays his effect on the populace and notes that people could’ve sworn Dylan was channeling him after he died. Nelson adjusts his body pointlessly as there is no more comfortable position on the couch than where he currently lies. Nevertheless, the adjustment satiates. He draws a finger to his lips in contemplation as he is reminded of Clark’s particular way of thinking old like Guthrie or a desert.
      <br /><br />
      ​A few blocks away Reginald is dazzling, at least as he sees it, the minds of his girlfriend Cassandra’s work friends and roommates. Some of them already know his routine: The discussion begins with him offering a fair amount of reasonable doubt to their existence while noting various opposing theories; most often the presumption that they would have already been discovered if they existed. Then slowly, through a few well-turned facts and testimonies from their witnesses, he resolves the measure and concludes with the heart-pounding undeniable fact. “Dun Dun DUH! Aliens do exist! There is evidence. It’s undeniable!” 
      <br /><br />
      The jury remains unmoved by his convictions as they crudely chalk it up to be another night of Reginald missing all the cues intended to sway him from continuing. He knows he’s stepping on friendly boundaries by dropping into this same damn conversation again. He’s watched himself do it so many times. Why doesn’t he stop?
      <br /><br />
      The next morning Reginald and Cassandra lie together in bed and split. Her guests left for home and the couple returned once more to her bed. The night drifted by and the sun rolled back into sight just a few hundred seconds earlier than the day before. An itch of boredom has been rising to their nerve-endings tempting them to scratch the empathy that is their kind and soft nest. It’s an itch of infinitude, dull yet expanding slyly like a roach problem, unbelievable roaches with egos prancing about your house and mind baiting you to crush them but only to release their progenies and spew their pheromones as to send the message to the other roaches: We have found the weak one willing to play our game of losses! Come roaches young and old! Grow eggs and be smashed into oblivion! Scatter yourselves for the sake of our ancient illusion!
      <br /><br />
        Nothing is perfect and Reginald could have paid more respect to that. Instead, he sought to take care of business. Uncomfortably chilled by the cool morning air he pulled a little tighter on the covers while being familiar with the physical laws governing such an action: more cover, more shelter, more warmth for him but for her, loss, vulnerability, yet another sacrifice. She said nothing this time. No humoring or partaking in his selfish yet interesting personality, no show of guilt for how small her blanket is. The pang rang louder with each note of quietude. Reggie considered himself infuriated and thus validated. He never believed he would muster the power to do this, to really do this. This morning however, that very thought turned over on itself and that fragile bubble of disbelief popped. Reginald’s nerve spun frenetically through the air like a cliché balloon as the last puffs of impulse control deflated entirely. He reached out and scratched harder than he ever had.
      <br /><br />
      “So, is this over then?” 
      <br /><br />
      Minutes pass in silence. 
      <br /><br />
      “So…” He pried again while balling up his jaw muscles to brace for this collision. At last she rolled over wishing to stroke his hair with the front tire of her car but instead she glared intensely bouncing between each eye. Reggie started sweating through his former chill while she collected each bead of panic like they really were bullets and loaded her weapon. The silent deposition is now complete and she is prepared to give her ruling: 
      <br /><br />
      “I’d say What the hell are you talking about, but I know that’s simply playing into your stupid game. So I’ll cut to it. You call yourself CAPABLE? Haw! Like you’re a real CATCH or something? I bought all your food last month. All of it! Meanwhile you threaten to quit this every week and I keep hanging on just to save you from yourself! It’s like you want me asleep AND awake, at the same time! It doesn’t make any sense Reggie and I can’t continue to be a patron to this toddler bullshit.” Reggie rolled his eyes. She took a deep breath, “AND you still smell like shit. It’s not funny anymore. Can’t you smell that? I’ve honestly lost half of my friends who can’t help but retreat from that odor and another evening of your blathering rants about the extraterrestrials! And the goddamn extraterrestrials! NO ONE CARES about aliens Reggie!” She stopped. She won. Obvious landslide. But for the final blow. 
      <br /><br />
      “It’s like you want me to be your mom.” 
      <br /><br />
      Despite her siege upon virtually everything about him: oedipal accusations, hygiene requirements, monetary difficulties, the only rebuttal with import to discuss was of course “the goddamn extraterrestrials.” It surged within him like a sugary beverage. He apparently hadn’t given up. 
      <br /><br />
      “There ARE other living beings out there Cassandra! I don’t get how you still can’t have any faith in that. Aliens are real! That’s it!” He brought his arm down on the bed like he knew what a gavel was, or like he was some kind of passionate diplomacy-oriented person resolute to uphold the deep things he clung to. As soon as the side of his hand hit her high thread-count duvet-cover she sat up and snapped.
      <br /><br />
      “HHHAAAwww! Fuck youuuuuu!” Almost singing it. She jumped out of the bed and started bouncing around the room, dancing and chanting strange sounds to summon his debunked soul and expose it harshly to the light. She clambered atop her armoire still only in her practical yet attractive undergarments and bent her knees with legs at an athletic distance. She started showing her teeth like a young gorilla then slapped herself! Then the wall! Then herself again! “WHAM!” She pounded the wall a last time to clarify her lividity with the crinkling of plaster. A few framed photographs fell to the ground and she pulled her fist away exposing the sizable hole. She yanked a piece of dry wall free from a dangling wire and held it up for Reginald to compare himself to. 
      <br /><br />
      After being given this apparent new truth about his personality Reggie scraped himself from the bed and was ejected from the room carrying only a tail between his legs. 
      <br /><br />
      A few minutes passed before he saw the last inch of her cross the cracked bathroom door where he sat contemplating a tear. It didn’t slam as she left and thus returned silence.
      </p>
      <br /><br />
      <h2>Cattle and Boy</h2>
      <br /><br />
      <p>
      In the distance there is a tower, a sky-scraping torch with a menacing blaze spouting voraciously bright flames at least dozens of feet up into the dark sky. He is flying toward this tower at unimaginable speed, so fast he’d lose his fingerprints if were he to reach out from the hull. He careens faster and steady like a magnet toward the tower. He must pull up, but he cannot adjust the course of his ship, “Pull up, goddamn you!” It does not adjust. “UP!” It will not adjust. “UUHHPP!”
      <br /><br />
      Clark gasps as his eye lids spring open. He peels himself up from the moist bedding of his sweaty, cold and dire sleep. He pulls his legs out from under the cover and sensory escalation. He shakes his head spattering the liquid about him and causing perspiration to drip into his palms as he caught focus on his fingerprints, 
      <br /><br />
      “What was that?” 
      <br /><br />
      He turns to remove himself from the bed.
      <br /><br />
      “AH!” He bursts in fright again! 
      <br /><br />
      The cowboy hat is on the table.
      <br /><br />
      “Where’s the lamp?” 
      <br /><br />
      A bed with one blanket, a dresser, a shelf of only complete collections, a mirror, and a small lamp sitting on a bed-side table compose the innards of his room. He scans. He looks closely at the hat. He lifts reluctantly as it’s damp and germ-content a mystery. 
      <br /><br />
      “Hwowee.” He wipes his brow in relief of finding the little lamp under the dome of the accessory. He tosses the hat to the floor in disgust. He stands, dresses himself, sliding all the necessary buttons into place to re-enter his well-preserved self-image. He turns around to confirm with the mirror that his appearance is properly arranged but is disrupted. There it is again sitting at his feet in the reflection of the mirror. He attempts to jump over it. His depth perception fails him in the reflection and instead of landing gracefully on the other side he is tripped up and tumbles into the shelf knocking the exactly organized books onto the floor and out of order. Reddening with embarrassment after what he perceives to be an aberration of clumsiness he lashes out at the hat! He swings his right foot toward the perspicacious enemy across the carpet floor. His visual gauging of the objects surrounding him is askew, now repeatedly, and the action of his big toe is thwarted painfully by the corner of his bed frame. “Ftunk.”
      <br /><br />
      “Yow!” He growls. The hat is still pointed in his direction. 
      <br /><br />
      “Fuck you.” He talks some shit to the hat as if it were looking at him belly aching in a deep cackle. His question why is there a cowboy hat in the street? morphed into a more distressing and pertinent question why in hell did I pick this hat up? 
      <br /><br />
      Clark stood and kept his distance, as to not underestimate its precocious nature. He replaced the books, keeping most of his weight on the left foot. He turns back to the hat. He strains to not holler as the damaged toenail snags the carpet he vacuumed so peacefully only a few afternoons ago. 
      <br /><br />
      “Now you will go!” He bestows a future upon the hat.
      <br /><br />
      He hobbled past its peripherals out to the kitchen. He scoured through a drawer of an unnecessary density of plastic bags to find the most sanitary of the plethora. After sifting through a list of pros and cons to decide which of the final two would be chosen he was forced to elect the largest that read, Thank You across its shell.
      <br /><br />
      He reentered the bedroom half-way expecting the hat to have hidden itself by now. It was still on the floor. He opened the bag wide enough to catch the varmint with two hands. He slammed the bag over the top of it, cinched the opening into his fist and smiled to himself in the wake of sequestering life’s controls again. 
      <br /><br />
      They left together through the barely used back door as to avoid interactions with either of his roommates, especially Reginald who, like gravity, would be required to pester him about the big Thank You bag.
      <br /><br />
      They stepped out the door into the   lands of the side yard and into a barrage of spider webs full of flies that had long accepted their failure to depart from the ornate trap. He flinched. But recovered and brushed his ironed shirt free of the freaky silk. They made it to the street. He thumbed through the possible options for disposal: “Dumpster behind the grocery, tie it to a cinder block and drop it in the lake, chop it into little bite sizes and feed it to the dogs?” 
      <br /><br />
      He shook his head, “What dogs?” 
      <br /><br />
      Suddenly, from the corner of his eye, while deeming his schemes scant, he saw Reginald stumbling around the bend in a deep stare at the ground. 
      <br /><br />
      “Oh shit!” he muffled. Clark jumped back around the side of the house to remain unseen amidst the spider webs and moisture. 
      <br /><br />
      “This is just ridiculous.” He complained. He looked down at the bag, “Thank You,” it said. He shook his head as to not accept its ploy of gratitude. He waited for Reggie to make it up the stairs to the front door. Reg fumbled the key out of his pocket. It clinked on the porch. He bent down to grab it and try again. Instead he smacked his head on the hand rail. The loud “thump,” was followed by an elongated “yow!” Reggie screamed for much longer than seemed appropriate for simply colliding one’s forehead with the rail. The volume ascended. It lingered at that level, “Oooowwooww!” 
      <br /><br />
      “Jesus Reggie.” Clark miffed to himself in concern for these wild lamentations. Reggie succeeded the second time in unlocking the front door and disappeared into the home. Clark jumped out from the corner and sprinted up the street in case Reginald returned to the porch. 
      <br /><br />
      Clear from the risk of his mission being exposed Clark is now free to re-address what he must do with the hat. A succession of empty bins lined the following streets but each possible solution passed on by without Clark being convinced of their worthiness for his soon to be estranged hat. “Well,” he said tentatively to each bin while stepping past. 
      <br /><br />
      He continued walking west block after block into districts of the metropolis still obscure to him despite his residency in the city extending nearly a decade. Eventually, at least a mile away from where the journey began, a slightly more gainful option appeared before his eyes. He glanced up at the sign and decided yes upon a thrift shop claiming to offer the most $ in town for used-clothing. He pushed on the door as suggested. The hinges squeaked a tenor cry notifying the associates inside of fresh clientele as it slowly let him pass. 
      <br /><br />
      “50 Bucks” he devised to be a reasonable bottom line for the piece. A handful of people occupied all the bench seats. Each of them were encumbered by enormous trash bags full of musty wear from their out-of-state upbringings at last on their final leg of dispossession after being staged in the garage a hundred Sundays ago. A seat opened up and he joined the pillowy line of cash-seekers after making his mark on the list. Moments passed in the briefly sunny window. He stared upon the varieties of speed with which other humans transported themselves down the road. The ones with full hands cruised the quickest which was paradoxical to Clark 
      <br /><br />
      “Well how about that?” He internalized.
      <br /><br />
      “Clark!” A woman with a true sense of urgency called out.
      <br /><br />
      He stood and stepped up to the counter.
      <br /><br />
      “Well what do we have here?” The woman behind a counter announced her presence in the form of a question. 
      <br /><br />
      “Well, a grown man, ma’am.” Clark assumed she asked about him.
      <br /><br />
      “What?”
      <br /><br />
      “I’m a grown man.” He said it again but didn’t enjoy repeating himself about such an obvious fact.
      <br /><br />
      “I’m talking about the bag, sir.”
      <br /><br />
      “Oh.” He paused to gather his wits out from under that confusing first impression. He looked back up at her-
      <br /><br />
      “What’s in the bag sir?” She reprised. 
      <br /><br />
      “Right.” He removed it for her to examine.
      <br /><br />
      “I see.” She ran her fingers along its contours; she lifted it from the side to peek under the hood. She noticed the thinning maroon polyester of the inner shell, “Mmm” she sounded off deliberately. Clark became uneasy as she finished her inspection and looked back up into his eyes. 
      <br /><br />
      “$3. Store credit.”  
      <br /><br />
      “What!”
      <br /><br />
      “Well sir, it’s-”
      <br /><br />
      “-It’s a real cowboy hat.”
      <br /><br />
      “Well yes, I see that, but it’s-”
      <br /><br />
      “-One of a kind.”
      <br /><br />
      “Oh? Well is there more you can tell me about the hat? You must have had it a long-”
      <br /><br />
      “No, no. I found it last night.”
      <br /><br />
      “Oh. Where did you find it?”
      <br /><br />
      “Sitting in the street.”
      <br /><br />
      “Well that makes sense why it’s so filthy, sir."
      <br /><br />
      “Store credit? Can you get anything with three bucks?”
      <br /><br />
      “Sir you found it in the street.”
      <br /><br />
      “I know where I found it!”
      <br /><br />
      Clark aggressively placed his hat back in the bag while eyeing the trendy woman and the rest of the spurious operation she’s been keeping here. Other employees’ heads popped up from behind racks of product like prairie dogs heeding a telepathic call for back up. 
      <br /><br />  
      “I know where I found it.” He repeated as he was forced to back down and dismiss himself from the establishment. He tried slamming the door while they shook their disappointed affects in unison, however the hydraulic-stop forbade any more of a scene. He looked down at the bag. “Thank You,” It said.
      </p>
      <br /><br />
      <br /><br />
      <h2>Restore</h2>
      <br />
      <p>
      Reggie had meandered several blocks home, smacked his head on the railing by the door while reaching for keys and fell back asleep, still unsure if a whimper was necessary to process this relationship fracture. His dreams wavered free from their resting places casting a spell of submerged psychical sensations and boggling hypothetical permutations: A girl from the past, his 12th grade girlfriend Daphne at a stand or kiosk of some kind where both of them are attending to thousands of people lined up to receive a pamphlet. He passes them out until his hands turn raw and bleed. He tries to hide his reddening mitts but can’t stop handing out the pamphlets.  His bloody palms and fingers are revealed to her at last. She becomes upset, turns around and her head falls back. Her jaw opens like an underground silo, “Oooopen, ooooooopen” she says with visible sonic tones hurdling out of her mouth, “Oooopen, ooooooopen…”
      <br /><br />
      He opened his eyes to see a phone buzzing. He opened the phone to hear Clark. 
      <br /><br />
      “What are you doing?” He says.
      <br /><br />
      “Nothing.” 
      <br /><br />
      “Oh. Huh.”
      <br /><br />
      “Daphne and I are through.”
      <br /><br />
      “Who’s Daphne?”
      <br /><br />
      “What?” 
      <br /><br />
      “What? You said Daphne’s through with you. Who are you talking about?
      <br /><br />
      “Who’s Daphne?” Reginald now asks Clark.
      <br /><br />
      “That’s what I’m trying to ask y-”
      <br /><br />
      “-Cassandra. Sorry. Cassandra and I are through,” Reggie winced, “if you have to ask.” He could feel her leave again as the news went public.
      <br /><br />
      “I didn’t ask.” Clark disposed.
      <br /><br />
      “She says it’s cause I talk about aliens too much and she doesn’t even believe they’re real. Can you believe that?”
      <br /><br />
      “She doesn’t believe in aliens? Who doesn’t believe in aliens?” 
      <br /><br />
      “That’s what I’m saying!” Reggie missed the sarcasm.
      <br /><br />
      “Ok.” Clark paused to gently brush his temple, “So you’re still at home then?”
      <br /><br />
      “Still?”
      <br /><br />
      Clark would never let loose any sympathy through the telephone and the electrification of info merging into each other’s ears and extinguishing realer modes of communication he claimed to fan. He only saw the latent effects of perky ideas turning obsolete and tipping over the future’s corroding cliffs, slumping shapelessly into regret down into the entropic crevasses of electronic history worthy only to be distrusted. 
      <br /><br />
      After briefly phoning Reggie, Clark meandered on along the road he’d first traveled this morning after another perennial stint holing up in his tidy and sterile room; obediently sparse to be in congruence with the pangs that guided him through each winter.
      <br /><br />
      Clark arrived at home. He inferred they must be sleeping and weeping as he passed each of their closed doors en route to his own accommodations. 
      <br /><br />
      He entered his room. He eyed the bag. As to engage what the hat proposed, he pulled it from the bag and let it loose on the properly tucked bed. It spun asymmetrically. It bounced along one side and came to a stop flipped over on its top demonstrating its hole for Clark most curiously as to invite his cranial presence. At first notice Clark felt as though the landing were some form of sortition as though he had been elected by every detail in the universe leading to the empirical prong of this very probability. He irreverently shook that thought or anything of its type from his mind though loosening his tight ribbons of hair obediently swept to three o’clock. It bade its credentials to be too fantastically, unscientifically and non-linearly sourceless. The question: Why hat there? Becoming: Why hat here? could not possibly then be answered for Clark by: Why hat on head? 
      <br /><br />
      “Yes” he said aloud, “No” he then pointed. 
      <br /><br />
      He thus denied himself the hat again and gave it a snarl, a sour wrinkle that stayed pinched just above the left crest of his lip. He then seized the hat with both hands. He brought it towards his notorious frontal lobe but heard activity in the lavatory. His ears twitched at the interference like an imp caught in the noon light. His attention snapped back to the hat and he hastened for the backyard. “It must be hidden.”
      <br /><br />
      The rear of their property was an amphibious utopia for native frogs and newts who truthfully appraise the value of semi aquatic back yards with shady trees to anxiety regarding a hawk’s eye, and untended splintery fences stymieing any raccoon’s jackpot, and of course the highly damp soil to burrow in. He hopped and skipped across the parabola of stones suctioned to the earth up to an old shed that had become camouflaged by the roughage of the small-grade hill like an elderly crustacean decaying along a boulder in its stern legacy of bad storms held on now by only a leg or two. He opened its abandoned doors after several yanks. It was rank with chains of fungi floating microscopically this way and that, now ready to receive their first experience of human consciousness. 
      <br /><br />
      He tossed the hat deep into the shed; way back into the dark. He did not see how it landed. 
      </p>
      <br /><br />
      <br /><br />
      <h2>The Bargain</h2>
      <br />
      <p>
      “Passing through orchards of consciousness, ripe and rotten fruit at its floor with potentiality, seed and flower still dangling like stars in a bushy universe un-birthed from their preconscious savannahs,” Nelson mutters to himself as to wind up the strength for this important moment. He looked at the two of them and spoke. 

      “I’ve acquired a new inquiry after a recent experience and would like to discuss it with you if this is permissible.” Nelson bowed to his constituents Reginald and Clark who were both reading newspapers on the couch. Clark actually reads while Reginald is trying his damnedest to not just look at the pictures. Reginald, the impetuous type, bites immediately. 

      “Oh yeah? What is it this time?”

      “Well gentlemen, after the events of last night I’ve come to believe that I am psychic. In fact, I know I am and wanted to simply inform you considering our mutual occupancy here,” he looked around with an arm outstretched, “in our beloved home!” He felt remarkable and unashamed in disseminating this very serious and sincere information. His weighted mind is now unburdened and the pineal is free to flourish.

      “What the hell are you talking like that for?” Clark blurted out. He was agitated by the word choice and pedantic lilt in Nelson’s voice. They, his constituents, were certainly unimpressed. However this laid not even the lightest scratch upon his intentions for Nelson’s metaphysical footing held strong after just last night stoking the fires of consciousness with utterly unabashed curiosity. 

      “So, what are these ‘events’ you’re talking about?” Reginald ignored Clark’s derision and played along though only to stave any vulnerable trains of thought about his own set of events that occurred early, just this morning. Nelson was fit to distract the unrequited one with his tale.

      “Last night, while at work, a strange and supremely eerie feeling came over me. It was as though I was being watched or participated with but not externally. It was coming from somewhere deep within, somewhere I had never been or can’t seem to remember. The skin covering my head suddenly felt as though it were truly on fire, each lock of hair swaying like a blade of flaming gas but somehow the blaze burned cool atop my head as to soothe rather than be insufferably hot.” 

      Reginald curled his brow suspiciously. 

      Nelson continued, “A trusted co-worker began to look at me as though I were about to lose consciousness. He asked in a rushed voice ‘Are you okay?’ Once again I could feel this altered presence, but now it was seeping out of me. I said nothing while he continued to investigate my affect then suddenly he no longer seemed like himself at all. ‘It’s in him now’ I realized. I knew he had the supremely eerie feeling strewn through him too, 

      “‘Yes, you are well. I have no need to be concerned.’ He said to me answering his own question. Then he left. 

      “The only thing in my mind to think after that was this phrase, or more like an insight with a melody: Buddha to Buddha communication. Over and over it sang through my mind, rubberizing and bouncing around for me. It took me over and somehow, with my mind now like wind, I believe it set me free.”

      The muscles surrounding Clark’s eyes began to squeeze in wariness while Nelson continued to verbalize what Clark concluded to be symptomatic behavior:

      “Shortly after my trusted co-worker left through a hall behind me and two other people went walking shoulder to shoulder past my booth. I noticed them only slightly due to being overtaken by what just happened. They opened the doors and were quickly out of my sight. The metaphysical jingle played again and again “Buddha to Buddha communication” until the trusted employee returned. But, he was free of the feeling this time and back to his wits, 

      “‘Did you see what just happened?’ he chuckled while expecting me to laugh along. But, I did nothing. 

      ‘Both of those guys just walked outside and pissed on either side of our double doors! Fucking disgusting! I hollered at ‘em of course. So don’t let them back in, alright?’”

      “He took off again but instantly I knew what I had to do. I had to walk through those doors and leave as the feeling had enacted for me, from within me, and I had to do it immediately! So I did!” Nelson paused. The silence itself even felt awkward while Clark looked to Reginald to confirm he was actually hearing this.

      “You just walked out?”

      “My job is of no importance in comparison with what I’ve now acquired. I left immediately as directed by whatever was awoken inside of me. And I left through the double doors.”

      “Because of the piss?” Reginald wondered.

      “So you really did quit your job! How are you going to pay rent? How are you going to pay for anything? Holy shit!” Clark put his hands to his ears attempting to block out the truth. It didn’t work. 

      “You’ve gone insane.”

      “I am not insane.” Nelson maintained.

      Clark lowered his hands to steady himself, then slowly moved them in the direction of Nelson as to momentarily soften the criticism toward his sensitive friend, “Look man, you just need to get your job back, okay? So go take a shower, or two. Then get your job back!” Clark drilled for sense but came up empty, while Reginald sniffed himself and pondered the criticisms he received in reference to consistent showering.

      “Just let me finish. There’s more. Okay?” 

      Clark folded up his paper, crossed his arms and looked at Nelson. 

      “Go on. You trampled through their piss…” Clark displayed his hands to signal Nelson to, of course, continue. 

      “Well, I went out to the street but no instant affirmation was shown to me-”

      “Great.” Clark celebrated.

      “-So I spoke to it, whatever it was, asking it what to do next and then I actually received a message! A very warm and clear picture of an old friend came before my mind’s eye. It was as though I could hear her talking. This thought, that thought, all of her thoughts permeated me like rainfall on the open sea or a couple of Californians suffering a spring deluge in a top-down convertible.” 

      Clark attempted the same hand motion but was met with decaying potency. Nelson rattled right along and he tipped his head forward. 

      “I somehow became the bearer of her substance and then knew I would see her. I continued walking toward home, the same way I always do and after a few blocks I was coming up Spring Street...” he gulps, “and sure enough...”

      The goose bumps on his arms rose as the information pored through him from last night into this moment. The skin of his entire cranium seemed to pucker up as though a loving owner were petting it methodically. The strange superficial sensation was coupled with an overpowering feeling of humility. Nelson let his head tip back prophetically. Reginald too sensed a certain charge spark the room. 

      “There she was! I couldn’t believe it! I was speechless. ‘Courtney!’ I shouted and waved. But she didn’t say anything. She was staring at something in the park. I walked closer to her and feared what might be the matter but as soon as I was an arm’s length away I became aware of what she was staring at. A sprinkler in the park across the street had broken and was gushing water that made for quite the fountain-like accessory in the lawn of this public space. ‘For three days the water has been running like that.’ She said to me.

      “I too stood in view of the broken sprinkler and continued the stare she had started. She walked away but I knew I need not say goodbye for something was already acknowledged. Soon she was out of sight and after staring at the spouting dilemma for a respectful amount of time I walked the rest of the way here in awe of what has come to be the most pivotal moment in my waking life. But again I was left with a new phrase from the supreme spirit, ‘Third’ it said.”

      “Maybe he’s just tired? Really tired?” Clark posited to Reggie beckoning assistance to steady the mess devolving before them. Reginald ignored Clark out of intrigue with Nelson’s claims, 

      “So you knew you’d see her? Like you really predicted the whole encounter?” 

      “Not the whole encounter but I knew she was coming or I was predetermined to see her, soon, pre-soon, before-soon.” Nelson replied.

      “But honestly, you really had that vision of her?” 

      “Yes.” Nelson confirmed with fervency.

      “And you could feel it being ‘soon’?”

      Nelson only nodded to confirm the follow-up question.

      “Hmm…” Reggie sat back in the couch, “So what are you going to do about it?”

      “I must seek a sage to guide me in developing the nimbility of this talent that I am so grateful for.” Nelson looked to the skies now with a righteous smile.

      “Well, let me know if you need help.” Reggie’s opinion on the story had flipped once Nelson mentioned the ESP-like activity. Reginald is well aware that such capabilities are very common in some alien species. Clark glanced at Reggie dismissively then gave his last comment on the matter, “Nimbility is not a word.” 

      He is very quiet but it’s a stretch to call Clark shy. He wasn’t your ordinary definition of the quiet guy having difficulties speaking to strangers with the anxiety and what not; that’s more like Nelson. Clark has none of that. It’s simply that he chooses not to talk and doesn’t seem to understand just why it is that other people speak so much. Those processes of thought that lend one to chatter and talking-it-out activities, narration of daily procedures and the relaying of information acquired in other group confabulation that is so popular among the common folk, died in him, a long time ago. 

      He adjusted his crisp newspaper back into the same form it previously possessed, everyday really, legibly unique slices of paper but held and folded the same way, everyday.

      “So where are you going to find the sage?” Reginald advanced his inquiry. 

      “I don’t know. I suppose another sign of some sort will unveil itself when the time is right, or when I ask for it.” 

      Nelson on a very different hand is a small person, not physically but soulfully. He is a mouse, a mere squeak in a roaring world of consciousness. He was doomed to fail, not to lose exactly because he didn’t believe in competing but being tossed aside and run over are well within the matrices of this nice guy’s daily probabilities. His lifelines are submissive. His fate is minute. All these things mean that he requires sympathy, especially from the eyes of Reginald and Clark whose brief spurts of kindness are incentivized by the amusing and inane quandaries of the now psychic Nelson. Given the world handed him virtually nothing in the way of physical talent or an attention span, Nelson learned to trust his intuition more than common sense or any of the five senses for that matter. As a consequence of this he has recently become emotionally tied to extremely general concepts like “spirit” and “being”, wearing them like a bandolier of impreciseness wherever he goes. Despite his unflappable belief that he had discovered something true within himself regarding these concepts, the rest of the world (significantly less delicate than he) watched on feeling sorry for him and out of charity chose to humor his cute intentions. Two of these humorists were in fact Clark and Reginald. 

      They came from towns beyond the western ranges and population density of the coast, from the thinner air of the high desert. Clark’s childhood, for one reason or plenty, taught him to be greatly calm in the solitude of desert stretches. He appreciates the act of dismantling or even destroying life’s complications. He is a desert, simple and heavy like a rock and impervious to the sappy goop of loneliness, in fact he laps up that solitude slowly and meticulously like a prickly cactus, simply there, amidst a desert. 

      Reginald is on a level where constant rebellion against his past reigns most important. If lost in the desert Reginald would surrender to the spectacle and blow through his supplies to die off loud and quickly in one cathartic blaze. Clark, still calm, would detect these reverberations while motionless, and probably not be above making use of the corpse of his dead friend. Despite bicker-worn gaps in even their best moments Clark and Reginald knew they could come together to protect Nelson.

      Along the way of his perpetual revolt against stuff that life makes him do, Reginald acquired a deep belief in and passion for aliens, as introduced previously. In that vane however he’s never considered himself too consumed with the litany of half-baked shows and clips of people divulging their weird nights in the woods. He sees himself as intelligent with a form of maturity and eliteness capable of leaping far beyond these screwball reactions. Although he has in fact made his position clear at many bar tops [“I’d get abducted!”] to similar and dissimilar patrons on multiple and repetitious occasions, the simple but boding word ‘too’ seemed to steer clear of describing his pupations, for instead, as he reflected, they ebbed outward premeditatedly like a decent fm radio station through the complicated swath of their town. 

      Nelson rarely spent as much time in his room as he did the rest of that afternoon. He is now unemployed however the main reason for being such a home-body today was to keep his efforts utterly focused on this psychic-hood gifted to him by that special feeling deep down inside. Being largely novice to his intentions, purposes and prayers Nelson stayed close to what he calculated to be best for his newly instated incumbency as the house-psychic: Buddha-to-Buddha communication and Third circled through his thoughts like encoded sound bites or last transmissions from the commander before the fuzz. To hone into the frequency of these messages and streams and enhance his meta-mental antenna’s radius he constructed a meditation pillow with the help of old sweatpants, puffy vests and several large cloth knots. Now with his HQ for finding the metaphysical, Nelson spent several hours on this pillow opening windows to increasingly more bizarre visions. Nelson’s breath and breadth of meditation deepened as these minutes, hours, and other portions of the day passed until late in the evening an intriguing hue shined forth: “It’s a green, a forest green, a green forest with a man? Is he sick? No he’s just lying down. Why is he lying down? Is it his chosen style to reach the stars or is he just tired?” Nelson peers deeper and there appears another body, a light-body leaving that man’s physical self. It eases away from his frame that is still lying unaffected. His arms spread and whirled from his hips like the spinning beams of a lighthouse as his back begins to right itself. His legs too compose a lotus position made of light. Nelson leans even closer to witness the moment when this illustrious light-form is completely freed. Seconds pass like millennia then suddenly, the man twists his neck and glares back at Nelson with green eyes! Nelson hyperventilates and is abruptly snapped out of this meditative state. He scrambles up into his bed keeping his eyes wide open for fear of what the hell just happened. 

      “What did I see?” 

      After lying there and putting another hardy dent in the earth’s twirl’ his fear subsided into a safe and cozy mood. 

      “But who was that?” 

      He straightened the relatively clean blanketing and slipped down in to get on to sleep and then, just as he was making his final descent into the unconscious his heart gave one bright beat and it clicked, “The sage!”  
      </p>

      <br /><br /><br /><br />
      <h2>The Coincidence</h2>
      <br />
      <p>
      The next day Nelson went walking through the streets of the city. He carried upon his head a large pair of headphones which bulged outward for easy notice and potential snickering by passers-by; many of whom indulged in the unkind projection of their insecurities. He glances, and glances back again at a poster that hugs the cylindrical plane of a domesticated column of wood. It mentions meditation and the power of hearing a prophet. The poster itself is green, printed by any sort of printer with the copy centered by the profile of a hairless man. 

The impetus of his walk was to test out a “guide to meditation” audio presentation claiming to offer a pathway into the astral plane and hopefully by such capacities another encounter with the green eyed man he met earlier. Being in such a mood and authentically attracted to such avocations this poster naturally caught his attention. He gazed deeper into the sheet of paper wondering who this person was and noticed the promoted event would be held in just an hour. 

“This is certainly not a coincidence for there are no coincidences and I have no other obligations, this, thus, is what is meant for me, yes, a faultless flush path unveiled somewhere between a system of fate and slippery choice itself,” he stated louder than he heard due to the innocuously bulbous earphones all over his head. Lastly, it was only a few blocks away which was also provocatively synchronistic and by his observable-world-transcending arithmetic anything but just a fact. Subsequently Nelson took the chance, attended said event and returned home to regale his housemates with another strange tale. The following leads into that moment:

It may have been a proper channeling and it may have been one of the creepier public gatherings Nelson had attended in his life however his optimism regarding said event kept him numb to greater repercussions of these facts and instead Nelson was quite inspired by the surprisingly large and sensitive crowd with equally soft smiles that he encountered while finding a seat. The facility itself rested in an enclave of the most recently constructed sport complexes in the city. Nelson deemed it to be worth at least a million considering the professionally painted walls and durable carpeting, “For the events it hosts must be multitudinous in their affairs!” He celebrated the inclusivity after rubbing the carpet. 

The man took the stage holding a very serious affect. It was almost as though he was trying to crap, but he wasn’t trying to crap. He was trying to channel. The microphone fed back a few decibels as the preamble given by another patron wearing a tucked in t-shirt concluded. The speaking tool was placed into both of his hands and in a low breathy voice he began.

“I am Peon” he said sternly. He takes a sharp breath and blows out from his mouth as though an army of candles were marching upon him. His cheeks are flush. His skin is clammy, and he doesn’t have green eyes. The people began applauding in worship of him in an immensely contorted effort. Many of them were jumping up and twisting their arms around like bendable straws with their lips tightening around their faces like lug nuts on spare tires and intermittently releasing furious praise for this Peon character like wet dogs let in from the rain. So far it was more like a high-theatric wrestling show than a guide to meditation. Quickly the crowd quieted down again as to uphold Peon’s very serious intentions. 

“Many of you have rightfully cherished past disseminations and heard the word however we must realize that there are many others out there and here too who do not believe in what I am. I bring this to your attention for they must know that I am right in what I say and this must be your responsibility. Your world is very different from mine, as I have explained before.” He took another intense breath letting his nostrils flare and ripple madly like sails on an angry sea. 

“Your world is going through a change.” This, for some reason, was a notable point and several people sitting in the rows in front of Nelson nodded vehemently in agreement. “However, today I must explain to you that a majority of your perception of reality is vested in misinterpreted beliefs. The cardinal modes and ethos of the universe are smeared with the overwhelming hostility and hypocrisy of your lives here on planet earth. As a being emanating from a reality-vibration far beyond that of your perception and planet, I am able to aid my beloved children in transforming. So, suited for this event and the depth of clarity and wisdom I sense here today, I have chosen to speak around the Principles of Magnetism.” A few people clapped again. Some of them examined their hands as they collided appearing absolutely blown away by the act. “It is a principle comprehendible to me and others of my realm in a way that light and sound are comprehendible to you in your frame of reality. Have you ever wondered why it is that when you learn a new word you see or hear that same word three times in the days after? This is like the color green where I come from. This is a Principle of Magnetism.”

“Green?” Nelson began tapping his fingertips along his lips.

“Have you ever considered the possibility that you attract your own destiny or your own fate? This too is magnetism however you are not the magnet. I am the magnet. You are not all powerful, as you may know. However, in developing, straining and even spraining your magnetic fields you may be able to receive the myriad of information; and send it as well.” Again he paused, for an applause though not as many people reacted as he expected; at this point they may have been expressing their zeal telepathically. Nelson scooted forward in his seat to be closer to the next turn Peon was going to take. 

“You can have the power to attract your own reality but it is through me, Peon, that this power is graspable. You will learn from me for I am right when I explain this. I have traveled a long distance to disclose these very important pieces to the puzzle. So, won’t you understand my dear people? My host has given his l-l-life!” He emanated the vibration of a victim by barely scraping that last sentence out of his throat. Nelson felt this vibration and assumed that Peon must be loving and honest and therefore truthfully a being from beyond that is channeled through this man who has been rejected by society’s ruthless judgment of the intuitively inclined. 

“It is up to you to enable your powers and attract your most supreme reality and this path is through me.” A man sitting in the front row raised his right palm in the air and bowed his head. Peon remarked upon viewing the reverence, “Yes my child. You shall learn and be mine. As said long ago you shall inherit and I will show you to your inheritance and keep it safe for you. Before us, beneath us, within our hearts, everywhere, the plane bemuses and resounds, flows and vibrates through the universe which is what it is. Reality at its most basic form is this energy. We can enchant and enhance our stasis of life with these,” he kneeled slightly. It was apparently dramatic based on the collective gasp whooshing through the crowd, “Principles of Magnetism! So come young people responsible for ruining the universe! Come be with me at the Manor and we will carry on without end!” They cheered loudly again with their brittle flexes of reverence leading to a real noisemaker of a man to herniate loudly and impolitely bump into more of the like-minded who, in the overwhelming riling-up of Peon’s plea for allegiance, took to all fours and began hee-hawing in the aisle.

The man channeling Peon moaned as well and clutched his chest as though he were really having it rough. His arms began to shake spastically. Then, in an instant the host regained all control and sat back down. Two people jumped on stage and started rubbing his back to soothe him through the come-down of this clearly excruciating thing he did for everyone. The channel was cut off. His mouth hung open. His spine curled forward and a minimal amount of sweat dripped onto an embroidered towel held for him by one of these underlings.

We return.

“So, you saw a crazy person give a speech today.” Clark said to paraphrase the occurrence without Nelson’s perceived magnitude. 

“Were they passing out any pamphlets?” Reginald asked recalling common merchandising methods of new agers in overlapping footage, and the relation to his dream. 

“No I didn’t see anything, must have missed it.” Nelson had in fact walked right by the table with a plethora of Peon’s promulgations that he somehow published (i.e. shapes and pictures on books and brochures referring to a Manor in some hills down south). Very much like his peers at the gathering, his sentiment was entirely sincere. Not even the slightest inkling of how overpriced the books were, the depth of Peon’s crude pupations or the hypo-mania overpowering a majority of the attendees dinged in his tender upstairs-place. None of the obvious made it through his density.

So he glanced plainly at them and strolled away realizating that he had been biologically called to realer duty. “All meditators defecate I must conclude with tact. With tact intact. Indeed.” He chattered to himself as he made way for the throne. The meditation feeling, the Peon observances, the eerie feeling had morphed and become an entirely new and more pervading feeling. It surrounded him like a warm blanket, nearly every turn in mental atmosphere was brought on with a splendorous surrender into the discovery of magnetic and psychic composition. These beliefs, the mystical beliefs that went unchallenged or without a physical ground, were gaining weight and causing all dubitability to fall from his mind. He noticed the gravity of these beliefs bending his mind inward and downward and felt the pressure as a sign to continue with every effort. He leaned back. Part of his spine pressed up against the porcelain lid which let out a heavy and painful scraping sound as it adjusted to his long back. His head tipped back and eyes steered up, looking over the upper portion of the shower walls which were covered in shaped tiles scattered around in various colors. His eyes fell out of focus, they started wandering, searching, scanning the crafty medium for meaning, they rolled across the installation from corner to corner until, “a snake, a dragon, a rabbit.” He concluded. 

“There’s a snake, a dragon and a rabbit in our shower!” He relayed at full sprint to the team as the water splashed from the faucet he left blasting. 

“They left.” 

  

  

 The Performance  

  

After Nelson trailed off and left the room, Reginald decided it was certainly time for a drink. He sees levity in such an idea, a lightness that will burn the wound shut, a shine that gets started early and exits the lounge into the magnanimous and buzzworthy glints of the afternoon cast over sun, with shine like a commemorative coin or a 1st or even 2nd place trophy sitting front and center on his mantle of all the awesome shit he does. Reggie’s gaze unto the shelf in Clark’s room way down the hall ceases with a slam.

“Welp I’m out of here.” He informed the empty room.

He nearly galloped out the door and down the street to the most local of saloons. He slugged beer after beer until his perky cheeks and swishy smile were ripe and swell again. It was then time for him to step out into this luminous pre-twilight air for a fresh smoke. He torched the other end and pulled a fat billow of the corrupt leaf. He let loose the puff slowly, pushing steadily against the breeze and the unquiet longing for her. Then it blew back in his face. The smoke dissipated from his suffering red eyes when he too saw a poster not unlike Nelson’s experience earlier in the day.

Poop For Rent it read.

“What?” He noised while flicking the ash free from the remaining ritual. 

“Dude!” he badgered some guy that chose the other end of the alley to smoke. The guy turned and nodded to passively dismiss saying anything back and returned to his lonely stare but Reggie’s enthusiasm had just begun. 

“Poop For Rent!” he shouted, “Poop For Rent!” 

The guy didn’t have the slightest idea what the fuck he was talking about nor did he appreciate the repetitive blare from this loquacious stranger. The smoker flicked his smoke to the curb only half expired and returned through the ramp and door to his stool but not before giving one last disapproving scowl to the erupting Reginald. 

Now alone, Reggie let out his fanfare decree, “Poop For Rent!”

After just a few more drinks, hours and blocks down the street, after Reggie fully primed his brain and sent spilling uninhibited skeins of deed down fully sufficient quotes and blares in roads and alleys, he arrived to see Poop For Rent. He scrounged a few bucks from the depths of his front pocket. The doorman, big-boned and prolifically showing in tattoos, reluctantly nodded at Reggie and ushered him past the entrance with less give than “big-pharma.” Reggie B-lined for the bar well. 

“Barkeep!” he shouts to the one in charge of such matters. He loves saying barkeep because it makes him different. It’s a testament to how often he frequents this place and demonstrates his well-exercised knack for clever word-choice. A tall-boy slides his direction. Of course a tall-boy, for there is no better flavor than the cheapest, no better choice than drinking the same thing every day. “And some of that ‘Quila’ too!” Again he poses a new addition to his unique colloquialisms. It does not appear they care. 

Reggie nods to accept their apprehension and is quickly converting it to inspiration. He downs the syrup. He bounces out of the well and spins round to make his oh-so-smooth entrance into the shake and sway of black denim hips and sweaty chests glistening under the two different colored lights, blue and a light brown light.  It’s a big show, and for it not being the fanciest joint in town they’d have to say it’s exciting. Almost twenty people are there! He makes his way up through the dampening crowd toward the front. He turns to the person next to him,

“You believing this?” There are PEOPLE here tonight!”

“Shitchya Reginald,” The unfortunate woman is forced to respond to Reggie’s drunken gusto. He then splays his pinky and thumb out wide and starts flicking them at a high velocity at her, squinting and letting his tongue protrude a generous length from his mouth. 

“Ok. Get it Reggie…” She states with just enough effort to not be rude. 

“You care for a smog?” he then asks her.

“Do I want some what? Go away a-” 

Despite the remarkable effort to cover her discontentment with his obnoxious facial behavior and indecipherable jargon Reginald received the hint and decided to go smoke alone instead of jostling around unwanted. 

He gets through to the patio which is equally packed with a small group of people but instead of the usual friendliness at least faked in his direction he only sees eyes scattering like rats in the night and several new hairdos he can’t get his head around. He takes the last seat, a makeshift seat in the corner already stuffed with people. It’s a board laying over some cinder blocks placed on the edge of the skeptical overhang referred to as the patio. He slumps harshly while smoking one and lighting another. He stares at his dangling feet watching things to say fall out of his mind and into the hoard of beer cans on the tufty grass pile-up down below. He glances around a few times but can’t seem to get up. The people are suddenly too heavily paletted for him to push their tastes out of the way, even with a few relatable black-denim-vested persons enjoying that same breath of fresh air. It’s tough to recall their former relations over the forgotten years, “people’s names coming and going like bus routes” he sighed. 

They don’t really enjoy his presence after many exposures to the repetitive subject-choice, word-choice, and beer-choice. And if he’s actually drunk, which, he is, they flat out can’t handle this wildcat. However his silence is new to them and it concerns two in particular, at least enough for the guy and girl pair to walk over.

“What’s up bitch?” 

“What’s up bitch?”

They said in unison while not enjoying the faux pas of their synchronized words because they are people who think for themselves. 

“The sky bitch.” Reginald choruses. 

“Weak.” 

“Weak.”

Again they judge in unison. Girl looks over to Guy and tightens her lower lip around a plug riveted into her face many years ago. The skin surrounding the ceramic turns an insinuating carmine as to show how his nose will look if he doesn’t stuff it. She turns back to attempt kindness on Reggie, 

“What’s your problem?” 

“Cassandra.” He looks forlornly to the left.

“Heard about it.” She confesses her knowledge almost sympathetically.

“How?” Reggie investigates.

“How? Just think about it for one second stupid-ass. Look Reggie, based on what people are saying you don’t get to be sad at all.” 

“Yeah Reggie, you’re kind of a piece of shit.” Guy says on his own this time. He nods proudly independent.

“Ah fuck. Like, whatever dicks!”

“Fine.” 

“Fine.”

Words and shoulders shrug in unison. They made an about face and walked inside seriously disappointed in themselves through each other for their co-dependent tendencies. The noise stampeded out to the patio as they opened the door and Reggie reacted in frustration, “Ah! Goddamn it that’s loud,” he shouts and realizes it’s the first time he’s ever criticized the volume of Poop For Rent or any band for that matter. He decides to counter this sensory overload and lapse of purely unshaken loyalty to all things loud by muting his senses entirely. He starts his return to the bar to preemptively delete the rest of the night. 

He stumbles in through the door into the crowd and bumps a dude with enough velocity for him to bump into a woman. The infraction is grumbled about but forgiven and unseen by the barkeep. He waddles shamelessly the rest of the way through to an open spot at the end of the rail and orders another shot of the “Quilaa!”. 

Reggie rocks his shoulders to the song Poop For Rent is playing, a song he’s loved so much over the past year. The keeper pours his shot then attends to another patron. Reggie leans his face toward the glass and rests his lips upon its pungent edge. He slurps down nearly all of it without lifting it from the chiseled and tagged wood. He gurgles, finally swallows, chokes and then coughs a little up on his face and the bar top. Behind him is a patron whose affect flips dramatically out of musical certitude to repugnance in sight of this adult-human disavowing even preadolescent development. Reggie hiccups for another beer and the barkeep still serves him! To the tender’s credit it is very loud, especially for this tiny joint which has caused him to miss these undesirable bodily effects emanating from the corner. 

“Mas cerveza por la cabeza!” Reggie exclaims over the euphony of mouth curling guitar picking, bass-lines that pump on your ribcage and carry on just outside your ear drums on a lone walk home and the undying bangarang of those drum skins tapping into the musical jungle-lude. Another tall boy slides on down just. 

The venue’s got those eternally entertaining swiveling stools, as he is aware. Reggie notices this again and starts twisting his hips around. From the view of anyone else he is doing this specifically to irritate those around him. He sucks a heavy portion of the cheap beer out from its spout.

The music comes to a halt because the song is over. There’s a quick applause that follows. Then the bassist gets on the mic and asks a reasonable question for an entertainer, “How’s it going out there?”

“Fucking horrible!” Reginald bursts back at the band like a tire popping on the highway. The bassist doesn’t have the greatest hearing and instead of dismissing the disaster unfolding at the end of the crowd, he engages, 

“Sorry what’s that?” 

“It-tss-fuh-kinguh-horrr-a-bull.” He repeats and assists everyone by pausing on some syllables.

“Okay man.” The bassist pauses and absorbs. “What’s keeping you down?” Many in the audience second guess the bassist’s sympathy. 

“I’m trying to j-joke it uh-up wi- ya!” Reginald slobbers. His head wobbles while he blankly stares at the stage, then replies with another jarring shout, “She won’t believe!” 

“Jesus.” The barkeep gripes at the cool-guy and their conjoined accountability in this matter.

“She won’t believe, huh? Well, you gotta show her the proof!” 

“How-woo do-oo I- do thaaaa?!” Reggie’s chin begins to whimper.

“Find it!” He shouts simultaneously advising the drunk-fuck and retaking the room. The crowd swarms his confidence. They explode into another hit, “Bam bam, csh, dum, csh, dum, bam, bam.” The crowd cheers and is unleashed to be free of the ill-groomed intrusion from relationship death into their entertainment. Reggie is befuddled by the action.

Reggie then looked down at the bar in awe of what this advice means. It revitalized a previously drained cell of inspiration. It clicked and he raises his head to the bartender as a climber, that is black out drunk, may do to a mountain. The tender swipes the beer and gargle-filled tumbler from his hands. Reggie is oblivious and turns again to the consoling bassist, 

“I will find her the proof!” 

The barkeep and the punk twins now in a formidable triad of rejection shout in unison, 

“Leave!” 

“Leave!” 

“Leave!”

      <h2>Treasure</h2>
      <br />
      <p>
      In the morning he propped himself up and rolled to work. He dismounted the steed, stallion, exquisite extension of his body otherwise known as a bicycle in the condition of Reggie’s fanciful maintenance skills. It boasts protective and tubular foam along the bars sheathed in shiny nylon dating to the excitable hues of early electronics and the spunk of decades past. The tires have refused to match for years demonstrating his rejection of any proper two-wheeled aesthetic. He’d occasionally attach fireworks to the back, or front, and speed down the hills of his neighborhood as to reawaken the attitudes of his 11 year old self, as to stuff in the mouth of maturity a rag doused in the angst of a lost boy, as to stymie the boulder of adulthood perpetually rolling toward him with the anti-heroic wedge of not-giving-a-fuck. 

Despite purchasing this genius invention from the same store as the young computeristo not five days older than he riding the money waves of the tech-boom, and receiving advice from said boomerite regarding the whereabouts of the (then) obviously located air pumps, Reggie is convinced that no yuppie persona could bare the authentic vigor and creativity with which he prowled the streets of his city. On sight they’d squeal and melt back into the numbing goop from which all these neighborhood wranglers came. Reggie, along with others of similar conviction believed they had indeed leveraged themselves away from the hands of the capitalist cyclops drooling for another lengthy gnash upon their sheepish souls that excrete the productive dung that is the idyllic consumer. 

The office opened an hour ago. Reggie rolled up late and reached for his lock to find nothing. “Hmm.” He left it at home. Not an unlikely oversight considering the volume of booze still pulsing through his veins. He escorted the vehicle inside and painfully looked around hoping for the absence of certain employees with loyalty to Cassandra that would be shuffling memos while pondering the gossipy news they received about the long awaited dumping of Reggie. Fortunately there is only one person in the office, Alice, which nearly brought a smile to his lolling cheeks. Despite the fact that she was rarely seen at the taverns frequented by the crew and that she despised the requisite acknowledgment of work-place drama, Alice had already been tipped off by Cassandra’s friend regarding Reggie’s possible inclination to babble and rant about the breakup. Equipped with said information and sufficiently disinterested in the problems of other humans, she delivered his assignments for the day and silently moved away from the desk as Reggie’s bloodshot eyes adjusted to the fine print. 

“Green-Pile, Nope-Town, Dumb-Place, Conference Center at the Stadiums. Oh yeah. The Conference Center at the Stadiums.” Reginald repeated aloud while recalling that Nelson had journeyed there to watch the channeling-guy only a day ago. Reggie looked up from his sheet and noticed Alice had fled to the backroom. He was correctly paranoid in assuming that this was the consequence of Cassandra removing him from the shine of her friend-circle, and not just Alice’s ever thickening shell of jade for the human condition. He let his head hang like an unworn hat will do for years upon a dusty rack and schlepped himself back out to the street like a sad puppet leaving its miniature stage. 

The Conference Center at the Stadiums seemed like an acceptable first stop. It’s a quick ride down a hill and a half through a wilier part of town where most of the people sleep in dying grass on slippery cardboard and under ceilings of cement ribbons hoisting up millions of drivers racing through their lives ignorant to this population’s soiled limitations. It is a part of town that is forgotten by these masses as the masses forget themselves in their calculated palms of white noise. It is a place where soul does in fact exist and can be revived in a hand shake and implode just as fast by a hand feeding poison to perpetuate the spewing hysterics of harrowed lives for all to see. 

Reggie took pride in his composure and decency toward others in this part of town. The rank aromas never violated his nostrils. The innumerable scabs dotting this community’s face never caused him to cringe. Reggie saw people, people that had nothing and somehow kept lively. 

“Livelier than all of them. That’s for sure.” He looked up to the highest floors of the surrounding buildings where he presumed the selfish and wealthy were sitting and laughing down upon all of them. The disease and vile manipulation turning these humans into hamsters inside a wheel of crack, meth, heroin and the subsequent generations of fetal exposure to diabolical compounds and the rolling dunes of psychosis displacing every thought, didn’t frequent Reggie’s mind. His compassion is instinctive rather than contemplative.

He rolled through that same part of town expecting his usual charisma and gab to emerge from this cloud he now suffers however his sweetly charitable banter did not arise. A blanket of dullness covered him up and left this fervor to sleep. A few eyes recognized him and tracked his course as he and his metallic steed clopped right past the shelters and villes awaiting the voice of this gallant man of the people. He pushed even harder to give his benevolent cry to the sorrowful flock he felt he tended to but when they approached only a stuttering message of retreat appeared, “I- I don’t know.” 

  

Without reason traffic was more reasonable than normal. Drivers were actually following laws, staying out of the bike lane and not screaming belligerently at someone on less than a percent of the amount of steel and rubber riding sustainably through public arterials. 

“This is rare,” Reginald managed to notice despite the googly-ing of his still-drunk eye balls. It occurred to him that he would soon be hung over and with that very thought it hit. 

“Ah. Shit.” A nerve connecting the cornea to his gut twisted its last degree. 

“Guh.” He gave up on looking at the road at all. 

“Ah fuck. That’s it.” The taste letting one know of imminent vom arrive on the back of his tongue. A few cars swerved as he weaved off the street onto the sidewalk. He dropped the bike and leapt. 

“Bluaah!”

Phenomenally, he tossed all of it into a public trashcan though unable to tell whether or not his contribution had worsened its odor. 

Another one, “Bluahguuh.” 

A final drop. “Puh.” He wiped his mouth with his now soggy sleeve and flicked a few bits on the pavement. Reggie looked up and realized there was a small audience of pedestrians observing his display of little self-control. They looked bougie (with a soft g sound), groomed and fitted frames of people-matter stooping to glance or blatantly stare with a finger and without the driest crumb of sympathy for his issues. Like statues, they are still and lifeless at the sight of this particular form of bad choices. He sighed out the frustration while feeling a resemblance to those he rode past just a jiffy earlier.

He looked up. He had arrived at the stadiums. The gyrating of his abused stomach finally quit and he is suddenly met with the merciful sensation subsequent to the release of booze from one’s lower chambers. He shifted into a mood of a perceived lightness and insight, or so it appeared to him. He hoisted his bike back up and walked alongside the towering and adjacent arena walls, 

“I do not fear you! You! A place of rules and teamwork and uniforms and on a field, place of decibels but not my decibels for I will not fear you!” He soliloquized his denial of any intimidations as his gaze came upon the gigantic portraits streaming down from way atop the walls showing highly accomplished and healthy individuals who additionally are even a year or two younger than he. 

“For I am the Anti-Sport.” Reggie continued with the punchy rasp of an old noir moving to the second act. His self-interpreted clarity was proving to be of a more brash and jittery specimen. Reggie may indeed be the “Anti-Sport” though only because of his habituation to bash anything that didn’t find habitation in the custom shattering jungles of Rock n’ Roll. Rock n’ Roll, a subject of much passion, carried enough groovy emotional weight to shake his mood into an even wilder spree. 

“They think we’re trash!” He screamed internally but intensely enough that his lips mouthed the words. He at last noticed this eruption from thought to involuntary mouth movements. 

“Have I been talking out loud this whole time?” He questioned but could not answer for himself. His eyes slid to the left and to the right seeing if anyone was witnessing this expulsion of words. A few people were making their way down the avenue, though they hadn’t noticed. He then met eyes with the very object he chose to represent his rage: trash, or more specifically a trashcan. He stared at the can as his mind continued unraveling in the dehydrated delusions of gran-something. 

“Rock ‘n Roll is a trashcan. Period!” he shouted his punctuation upon the inanimate object under the enormous awning of the stadium, again not realizing he was saying all of this aloud. For greater clarity into Reggie’s poetic license we can humor that  Rock n’ Roll may very well be a trashcan in that it contains things cast away by society that could possibly be transformed into something strong, beautiful and redefining of what scent sent them away from becoming treasure. 

“A rock show that is a trashcan! A great and giant trashcan with only the greatest band’s jamming the fuck out, all of the people soaking in the fumes of the giant trashcan! Jumping and crinkling in the truth of the acquired nectar that is the giant trashcan!” 

At this point a most audacious idea cropped up in that devoted brain of his: “Walk over to the trashcan, dump it out and jump inside! Open the club right now! And in the name of Rock n’ Roll.” 

The ramparts of sanity, long weathered by a lush siege, are to topple. He stepped a few steps up a few stairs to be on the same level as this grail of the aluminum Dionysian. He emptied the trash. He climbed inside and began to head bang like a jack hammer got rhythm. To his credit the few people passing by had their days made while being gifted a story to last at least a month. Reginald was oblivious to this and after several minutes his solo mosh-pit faded from record. He stepped out of his new favorite club in town and was immediately given applause by this second audience who had been nearly barreled over laughing. Reggie didn’t trust the meaning behind their actions and instead of bowing or just walking off stage he threw smatterings of trash at them while shouting various uncouth personal attacks. They found this to be hilarious as well but caught the drift and briskly moved out of the line of fire. 

He took a deep breath as his fans left and crumpled the last piece of trash in his fist to bring a seal to the flood he just emoted. He then paused, looked down at the paper and recalled his devotion to trash. He calmed and decided it was foul to treat this last piece of paper so maliciously. So he uncrinkled it. 

“It’s one of Peon’s pamphlets about the Magnetism and the Manor?” The co-incidental truths of finding a pamphlet, an element to his dream after his extinction from Cassandra’s kingdom, and it being Peon’s pamphlet were far too potent for Reggie to dismiss. 

“The proof. Find the proof!” He shuffled round to hoist the bike into its most effective direction and sprinted off by crank and sprocket back up the hill to follow through with destiny; this all-of-a-sudden-last-chance-there’ll-ever-be kind of destiny, or a presumed-to-have-been-lingering-there-waiting-for-him sort of destiny; the one and only route to pull from thin air the vital and empirical proof that Aliens are real, this sort of destiny mighty above all kinds, this, transcendent and radiant dimension-hacking this, the fell-swooping of history books, every-ounce-of-it-seducing this, this over any other this and away from even comparing to any countering destiny; this that is no longer stranded at sea or space, a this that has a now, past, future, traversing toward this, this with one pertinence. 

“Once and for all she will know!” 

He laughed maniacally while juggling between glimpses of the pamphlet flapping in drizzly zephyrs of the afternoon and the forward perspective it takes to manage such a ride. He passed through congested intersections unable to even brake for the demand to start this journey pressed so harshly, to be with his heavenly mate, as to re-inaugurate with the woods and rivers of love and domestic adventure, to such a simple embrace, simple and securing. 

“She will have her proof! It is my duty!” People glanced at him as he shouted his vow zooming through the tree lined streets recalibrating the forward sensors to his tack. He knew exactly who he must speak with. He also knew that person would be sitting at home because he left his job to follow a voice in his head. 

“Nelson!” Reggie burst through the door wobbling like he’d rehearsed it. Small dribbles of spew remain on his chin and jacket.

“Nelson!” He storms further into the house, stepping heavily and letting out quick breaths of acidic vapor. 

“Nelson,” he attempts to state much more calmly while slapping the brochure and his entire body onto Nelson’s door. The door is not locked nor entirely closed and thus it swings open with tremendous force. 

WHAP, THUMP 

It bangs against the wall and Reginald drops face first to the ground. He loses consciousness after reaching his destination. Nelson spins round from gazing into the wall and shakes with fright. He shyly removes his bulbous earphones. The trembles subside and Nelson walks on his hands with his legs in the lotus position over to Reginald. He jostles his shoulder. The disturbance doesn’t wake him though it does release various toxic molecules that cause Nelson to frown slightly. 

“Why this then?” He notices there is a crinkled sheet pasted to his chest by the adhering fluid. Nelson peels the page away from the mess with curiosity but nearly burps. He holds it vertically as far away from himself as he can, the unsavory colors run down and drip onto the legs and hips of their maker. Nelson remains patient until the original print is again visible. “Come to Peon’s Manor.” He reads on: “There are no coincidences. You will see.”

“What? Why have you brought me this, this from Peon, this puzzle in the puke? Could it be a significant sign? A sign so significant we must search out new signs, signs on roads and off ramps, a sign that we must change course and steer clear of the old ruts in the drill as to bond anew and free of it all? Is a time of going to a different place afoot? Is this the smell in the air? Is there any other possibility than his message from way out there being just this, a heavenly subpoena to arrive at the designated location within 72 hours?” 

Reginald remained on the floor of Nelson’s room respirating loud and coarsely.

      <h2>A Run On Serendipity</h2>
      <br />
      <p>
      _We tack backward in chronology ever so slightly,_ 

_to be informed of Clark’s most recent affairs_. 

  

“It’s a hideaway. It’s hidden. Good.” Clark thought. Though he still ruminated around the option of muscling his way back out through the vivacious and temperate backyard to view and don the stoic cap just one time. His impulses were distracted entirely however as he heard the crash-bang of Reginald come pouring in through the front door. 

“Still drunk.” He instantly recognized; just by reverberation of the door and the inconsistent time between two steps. 

"Nelson, Nelson…” he heard from behind his closed door.  

“Damn it Reggie.” It dawned on Clark his pal Reg could very well use his help in the form of a talk.  Clark, as one may expect to observe, habited to make distance from people in these highly needy and emotive phases in life, effusing feelings going this way and that, each deprecating proclamation needing a speedy redirection. 

“So unsanitary with their souls,” he lets himself think, “He’s at his worst! First, he’s oozing with that wretched drink! How is that within any reparative methodology? And Clark can’t say anything. And Clark can’t whisk it all away. What good is Clark in a fixed bout with Reggie’s own vortex of thoughts hissing like rattle snakes full of venomous nostalgia and existential crises frothing and bubbling-up sadness all over everyone, the inevitable scene of bottoming out of any victim to ‘the breakup.’” So crossed his mind. 

If the stars could respond, as they may have, they would’ve called Clark a coward, weakly interactive with the populous and a true-blue apathizer. 

Just in that instant he heard a second much louder and out of routine crash-bang. 

“WHUMPAMP” 

He could not pin its epicenter. 

“What was that?” He asked aloud in the direction of his windows as though the curtains were his look-outs commanded to respond to their captain when tasked with questions of this sort. They said nothing. He could see a sliver of the shed through a gap in their coverings. He then sprinted out the side door and into the back yard with a squish in every step. He loses traction, he goes down! He reels himself upright tacitly and lunges toward the door of the shed. He opens the door. His eyes instantly zoom to the back wall, like spears, like battering rams with a surplus of momentum for a proper barging. 

WHAM! 

There’s nothing back there. 

“What?” He calls out again. He takes long steps into the dark hold-out. He creeps in as his shoulders shrink toward each other; his arms too recoil in effort to evade any nasty contact. Not just their tip but only the slightest part of his battered toe surgically grazed the rotted wooden floor. “Yeep!” He decreed as he reaches the end. Nothing. He turns back to the outside world reacting to this befuddlement with hands scratching at his temples. 

“There it is!” Staring him down again, seemingly lucid in its eyeless observation of Clark slinking about its domain. “What in tarnation are ya doin’ over there?” He interrogates the hat unsure from whence his jargon came. His hand slides toward the tip of his chin to grip the concentration required to file through all of the possibilities of how the hat got over there. He retrieves the hat one-handed and in casual form. 

He tries to put the hat on.

Almost like repelling magnets, almost like an invisible pulley system, almost like a chunk of gravity landed right between the coordinates of his hand and the summit of his gourd. He almost puts the hat on. He strains again to get it on there, to simply get it round there. He re-grips and clutches the topmost part of its whole and wrenches down again until his muscles ripple like the jowls of a mighty steed, “AAGH!” he lets out. 

“BUH-RUM-BIM-BIM-BULLL” rumbled the shed. 

“Did the shed just rumble?” Clark shouted in terror! The reverberation of the shed broke his concentration. 

“Two-hands!” He came screeching out of his mouth as he tore out of the shed, “Two-hands! Two-hands!” 

He shouted as he sprinted away from the mind-splitting phenomena with the hat in both hands in front of him like he were rushing an entree. “What in heck was that?” He asked the hat, now inside. He threw it on the bed again. It rolled as it had before and landed head up, not facing him. Clark turned around and opened the door intending to find out if his roommates heard the same rumble out back. He stepped toward the main room and stopped when he saw Reginald’s legs splayed out of Nelson’s door. He stepped quicker. He beheld Reginald passed out with his back bellowing up and over like an old rotary dial and Nelson holding a sheet of paper covered in vomit. It smelled. 

“What are you DOING!” Clark bellowed at Nelson then covered his nose. 

“Clark, Clark, …Clark” Nelson panted the third time but was sent adrift into temporary catatonia- “Flash whizz zang,” bubbled out of the almost undetectable movements of his mouth. Internally, he saw something fold before his mind’s eye like a show of quantum acrobats flinging and slicing notions, like voices of light, like ultra-lit bells and whistles it called and then asked of him pejoratively 

“How do you truly wish to be treated?” 

Then they pulled apart seamlessly and silently like limbs of a shadow puppet, like infra-red noise it passed and from behind it reemerged a Nelson no longer in pause with these deep reels of thought. His eyes rolled up to Clark.

“TAKE US TO CALIFORNIA!” He exclaimed. “BECAUSE!” Nelson immediately jumped to defend, and now with a shiver and straining eye-contact upon Clark. His vigor diminished and he fell quiet again. He looked to and fro at the both of them.

“Well, I didn’t ask why.” Clark said, a second time.

“Aliens.” Reginald suddenly contributed to the proposition from his partially prone position. 

“Aliens.” Reggie miraculously, droolfully, said again as a tear fell from his eye. Clark found himself wordless. 

“Because the supremely eerie feeling is losing power! It is me!  
I must be restored!  I must confess. So be it, and do it and take us to it, to California!” He repeated. Clark scratched his head. Nelson scampered back into his bedding and quivered in the corner. Clark looked over at him then back at Reggie who appeared to remain unconscious . 

“What are you asking?” The confusion had furrowed his entire face. “Don’t go in the back yard.” Clark then back pedaled out of Nelson’s room and made haste for the front door. He stepped down the wood steps connecting the front porch to the sidewalk. He approached his vehicle amidst a moment of shuffling through terms by which to understand this ongoing calamity. He grasped the driver door and looked to his left. 

“My roommates are idiots!” He let out into the street while slipping down into his car but in two steps as to properly emote the uncertainty bifurcating his intentions, first having a seat, then sealing the hatch.

“They’re losing their minds.” He stopped his words short. His face, mouth and cheeks wore their incoming doom while the clever orchestra of muscles surrounding his lips filed through utterances of what to say to these partners gone strange. He looks to his left, again, south, down a street where he’d be driving the sharp clunk of a ride if he were to start it up. 

“A poster? A fresh poster.” He describes his own gaze.

He looks at it. His neck scopes in for useless re-examination.

“Well, if that ain’t-” 

He opens up. Crosses the street. He walks up to it. 

“Missing. Cowboy Hat. $50 REWARD.” 

Clark didn’t chuckle in response to the bounty. He had trusted his judgment to be sound and for Clark that issued no sound, no sound at all, at first. Just a quiet acknowledgement. Just how he likes it. Then internally he sowed other ventures,

“There’s your money, you hatter! Ha! For a hat. This hat. That hat. And how? How it teases me. For what do they want now with my acquisition? And for what repurpose could it be after going without notice in the cold and rain and drear and mange of the gutter. So they want it back. My hat, my want. But never will a want that is mine be so easily re-probed by such a hapless proprietor for remounting. So no. And no again! Yes, in all accordance with the negation. No! This want, a swank want will not go. And by that would not I forego-?” He paused. He looked up the wooden stairs. He ascended them and through the door. 

Several minutes hovered outside their unattended porch and street with twigs popping and gasps of a breeze dropping beneath the shadeless trees ruffling through their currently grey lit neighborhood. 

From the front door we then see them emerge. Clark is led by the cowboy hat as he ducks under the threshold. Reginald is unconscious. Nelson has Reggie in a full-nelson and gets him down each wooden step. After that both of them drug him precariously into the passenger seat of the Rabbit though, through the driver side. 

“I’ll be in back.” Nelson commented and nodded to himself as though Clark and Reginald were not the only ones with him to consult about seat assignments. 

“Where’d you get that?” Nelson asked of the hat by pointing with both hands, as to cautiously not sever some kind of connection developing there. The seat flexibly offered passage to its backseat patron. Nelson balled himself up into the back. Clark swung into his driver spot. Didn’t say a thing. Their narrow street quietly unveiled an exit path before them through micro-cosmic fibrousness and perennial arcs of chloroplasts, through these trees softly oxygenating outreaches of green by-ways, and the leaves bright and generatively flowing about like little organic kites waving Adios Tontos! 

He turned the ignition. He felt a rumble. 

“No coincidences?”

“Yes.” Nelson whispered.

<h2>Part 2</h2>
<br />
<h2>A Library in the Entendre </h2>
  



  

It is a short and compact ride obsessed upon throughout its history as an underestimated model on the market; a car that defied any heavy-duty syndrome happily cruising without the overstated power among the throngs of garrulous and massive whips it encountered on careening transport ways. Nelson placed his hands peacefully in his lap in the back seat with the posture of a valedictorian on the first day of school. He placed the earphones upon his head and set his eyes to wander. 

They leave the city to a stand-still however, a stick in the mud, traffic thick like corndog batter at the county fair, uselessly seized traffic being trafficked in from every frickin’ elsewhere, pinned in with the saggiest sandbags ever piled on and no longer in preparation but nearly in retreat rutted industrially like amorphous polymers and alloys blankly waiting in line; with thousands of souls lapping up its time-sensitive incoherence though clogged every time per usual, per mile per usual rushed hour, and on going patterns fall apart and so and so slips into third a little late while the domestic just behind has to give it some respect. It reverts back through grand alleys of equipment sparked with compression and boost, pound after pound of tenacity once revving, now slamming! Brakes not unlike theirs, squeeze in desperation and screech to a halt at a bruising rate. Someone’s narrow lane has broken and busted open into smears of burnt rubber with remnants of taillights and bumpers strewn about the scored asphalt. At last, they pass city limits.

  

Reggie is mouthing long syllables with many long “o” sounds extending for seconds and miles along and against the clear trickle of sparse light across a placid ocean spreading out from under a dock, the light bouncing back at him like mute lightning bolts across the water like light-canons made of cotton having opened fire. He focused out across the brilliant water on lips stretched across an enormous jawline with pale orange and green drops sliding away from its cusps.  He stays with the lips until he sees they are smiling at the end of a worn dock. And with eyes across the wooden slats looking at him and smiling. The smile opens and out splashes its drenching contents

“NOO!” Reggie cries.

“What in hell? Having you a nightmare?” Clark quanders.

Reggie sits up and is presented with the open road and the ample engine rumbling and the letting out of clangs settling back into gases and hums filling their musty and bolted-in cabin arrangement. 

“Are we in-”

RMRMP! An unexpected pothole in the road shakes up through the frame and body and Clark counters with a jolt of rpms. 

Clark’s got the hat on. 

Reggie’s never seen Clark in a hat. 

He looks to the backseat. 

Nelson’s eye lids open slowly as if on remote command like garage doors. 

Reggie leans forward, “California?”

“Tacoma.”

“Oh.” Reginald trailed off as the o approached the h.

“No on Tacoma? Welp, it sure duddin’ care. And y’know what? I like that about Tacoma. It couldn’t give a cowpat!

  

  

He drives, they ride, for hours, for hours and hours passing through county borders sparsely perforated by unique paranoias and municipality’s sway cloaked in and other lovely-to-be snake-boot charmers and warm-hearted robbers and twitchy followers and all the while, round every corner, a bunch of the same-old. 

Galleries of several century young trees don’t seem to hear as they pass by, they don’t appear to get ahead of themselves in their recollections of history, they triangulate outward in humbling ubiquities, trees making magnitude at each mile post that peels past their careening coach. They are trees in guffless being. They don’t quite see the passers-by or relate to their dysfunctions nor achievements. They can’t quite tell anything and are thus dutifully show-only with all 500 years of un-truncatable burden, bird dung and sunning surfaces pouring up of all ways, up to the fiery gravity-boss, thee photosynthetic romancer.

Reginald turned away from the window, reentering himself after sojourning at length, mentally. Clark’s hat fills the cabin. Reginald turns to Nelson, 

“So can we get back into that…” having to pause unsure of how to put it, “that psychic, coincidental stuff? I’ve just got to remind you as I’ve done before that I think you are onto something. I think people really can be psychic. AND,” Pausing for suspense, “Can strengthen their psychic powers! It has to be possible.” He stretched himself out to get comfortable with the revelatory direction the discussion would be aimed. 

“We’re growing ya know, developing, evolving, we’re evolving ya know.” He nodded expectantly at Clark awaiting his contribution to Nelson’s psychic development.

“Yes we are evolving. How does that become the psychic itch you keep scratching?”

“Alright take this for an example. I’ve been thinking about it for awhile.”

“Would you consider this one of your theories?” Clark recognized the pattern.

“I mean it is a theory.”

“I know you have theories. I know this because you continue to tell me about your theories, just like you’re doing right now.” 

“Well imagine that you’ve only ever known how to read aloud.”

“-and by stroke of genius you read silently?”

“Yes!”

“Reginald do you realize—”

“—That I have genius thought experiments?”

“No. But each time you insist on repeating—”

“—You learn that to read internally to yourself there is one less step.

“No.”

“Analogously, after learning to eliminate sound as essential to transmit information, we can postulate other aspects of human communication that can grow to be obsolete.”

“If you swap in fallaciously.”

“Could it be that after thousands of years of reciting verbal language to communicate a previously untraceable growth of our mind has emerged and is now sliding into focus? Wouldn’t it be more than likely to find that consciousness, by being what eventually forms our DNA into growing stronger and healthier, is leading us to become telepathically knowing of how to alternate planes of this stuff called consciousness?” Reggie paused. “What?” Reginald reacted to Clark tilting his hat back. 

Clark took a long starless breath.

“No.” He concluded.

“What?” Reggie didn’t gather his response and reacted by twirling his fingers hypnotically goading Clark.

“So you think Nelson’s the first one to read minds on the inside instead of reading minds out loud, by asking questions or something?”

“Well yeah that’s a part of what I’m trying to say but I just mean that there’s more out there. Alright?”

“No. You’re not JUST saying there’s more out there. You’re saying, theoretically, there is more to this ‘stuff called consciousness’ and that this special ‘stuff’ is currently growing to a point in EVOLUTION where we can hear thoughts falling out of the foreheads of every babbling wrinkle of hypocrisy out there.”

“It’s not just humans Clark.”

CLICK. Clark’s seatbelt unbuckled. It happened the very instant Reggie stopped waving his fingers around, to accentuate the mystical vibe he wishes to purport.

“Dude, see! The universe is telling you something!”

“You’re trying to tell me my seatbelt unbuckling is like a sign or something? Why do you think like that? It’s not a sign.”

“It is too a sign Clark. That’s it.” Reggie came to a rest.

“No Reginald. See this is what I’m talking about. The psychic-phenomena-endlessly-serendipity-bullshit is bullshit. It’s not what is real! It’s just a weird way of looking at the ‘stuff called consciousness.’”

“Well who’s to say that the weird way isn’t also real?”

Clark ignored that last part swiftly while passing a bus as the solid lines broke into a dashed straight away. 

“The REAL sign is that the seatbelt buckle is old and I need a new one. Do either of you realize that?” Clark clicked the buckle back over his clavicle and lap.

“It is meaning. Meaning is everywhere. Everywhere is meaning.” Nelson glides into the discourse with a reversible-statement of sorts that leaves little to no content to extrapolate on.  

“The quiet one speaks! Please, dearest sensitive one go on.” 

“It is meaning that speaks and connects and contours to frequencies. Meaning is meaning itself.”

“Okay, okay gentle seer of visions. So you’re telling me there are multiple meanings to the one event. Okay, and your telling me that my meaning, what I saw in the seatbelt-event is true, in a way, and gets just as much significance as any other meaning? Like what the hat thinks?” Reggie went to poke at the hat and was swatted away.

“Yes you are the key to what it will mean, gracious Reginald!”

“I guess it means we’ll hear it. It also means that it’s hearing us. It means we’re going to find some fucking Aliens!” Reggie plotted some logical outcomes.

“Say. What business is that again?” Clark threw a wrench into  Reggie’s system, “He just isn’t ready Nelson. You got any more of those brain-drops of wisdom to share with us Nelson?”

“Yes, there are many drops to share. I wish to explain but please understand that I am no master and therefore no teaching of mine will compare with Peon.” He paused for reflection. “For me it starts with this question: what is the fundamental nature of reality? However it is inducing the question, fully taking on the question and engaging it with all of my being that became fundamental. To ask is to become the question with your every being.

“Well, that sure ain’t what I meant.”

“Oh, I like it. So not just think where are the Aliens? Engage that question with every single one of my single beings?” 

“Well yes I guess that is the question: What is being? And the past nights I’ve tried asking this and many other questions, wishing them, even willing them to protrude out into the void, to cast themselves up into the cosmos of mindfulness and down into the very quantum make-up of super-strings and nothing; and I believe that this protruding beacon will somehow guide an answer back to me.”

“Protrude on my friend! So what were the other questions you asked?” Reggie retraced.

“Here it is: If telepathy were possible would it not be a discovery of something already having existed but previously unnoticed and seemingly uncharted? Would it not be a stream of consciousness we have crossed inattentively for tens of thousands of years like the planetary bodies that without notice or possibility for return became completely rearranged and the highest known Gods of being fell in scopes we never imagined and instantaneously so. And if that were so, in what field would our minds be able to gather and be identified and be noticed and introduce themselves to one another? It was from this conditional point of projection that I asked another question which seemed like the final question in this heady devotion: How would you know? Then it came to me, complete and simple. You’d know you’d know. The ‘knowing’ in of itself would recognize itself within the other self that is getting to know this knowing, which in of itself is in a way ‘knowing.’”

“Wait. The you that knows the you that knows how to do telepathy knows the you that knows the you that isn’t just making all this bullshit up?”

“Shut up! You are not witty. Sshh. Go on supple orator.”

“Because of that complicating swirl of the vectors of consciousness the only entry would then have to be love,” his eyes barrel rolled like a doomed spitfire out of the soaring clouds into view, “Or consciousness.” 

“What?”

“You must love to be informed. Love to decode. But I must now continue dear hatted zealot. May I follow through? And for the sake of those to come he knows you will be there. He has shown it.”

“Hatted zealot? Well you sound fucking loco!”

“Whizz zang dangle.” Mumbles Nelson suddenly interpreting a spell or something coming over him.  Another unpredicted bout of catatonia ensues. 

“Nelson.” Clark barked, “He did this before, and before before. 

“What? Quit it with Nelson, ya fugly looking soul-breaker.” Reggie swooped in to defend his friend.

“I then caught access to something.” Nelson popped fluidly back into disposition.

“Oh? Access? You have access?” Reggie’s head begins to bob as he lets in these provocative testimonies and they find cause within him.

“There is something potent and wild in here and the out-there that is in here,” Nelson drew a finger to what first seemed like his gonads. It was then clear to only Reggie, who watched on, that he pointed at his navel. 

“Dear ones. There is an undertow to each and every moment. That is what a moment is. Under.”

“What in a dry cake a scat is he saying Reggie! Won’t you two see beyond all that? Don’t you know where you come from? Who made your meals when you were a youngin? How you got better after catching some congestion up in the pass?” Clark interjected homely in this questioning.

“I’m getting goosebumps!” Reggie exclaimed his amusement and successfully stuffed out Clarks grieveances.

“Oh, that’s been happening to me as well.” Nelson concurred. 

“Goosebumps? You ever read those?” Clark calmly chose to compete, “Or the show, y’all ever catch that ol’ program? I remember a Goosebumps with a Monster Librarian who turns violent when he starts slamming too many of the crickets every night. It’s about drinking too much. Like you! Y’all remember that one? It’s a good one.” He ended still pointing at Reggie and his habits.

“I feel bad for the Librarian.” Nelson said flatly thinking this was a real person he spoke of. He then stared at Clark.

“Oh, is it because he’s missing out?” Reggie sourced.

CENTRAL LIBRARY NEXT RIGHT. A sign. A library sign standing pragmatically just past the ditch as they cruise by within half a mile from the next turn off. Reggie netted this one in record time. 

“Library! We’re going!” Was all he said to steer the trio to their next destination.

“Why?”

“Because you were talking about the library. Don’t you feel that. There’s exhilaration in this Clark, it’s here waiting for you.”

“So we have to go in there? Aren’t libraries closed on days like today?”

“What do you mean?”

“Every library is closed on random days of the week.”

“Well let’s pretend it’s not.”

“Well by your calculus shouldn’t we not have to?” Clark corkscrewed his twisty extra negativities right into Reggie. He pulled the wheel round into the parking lot that spread out around the bottom of a hill upon which the library is perched. Reggie and Clark look at each other, each not wanting to have the next word.

“ARE WE GETTING OUT OF THE CAR?” Clark then decided to dictate his question to them loudly. Reggie pawed at the door, wiggled the handle with various approaches learned over years of jimmying. Clark was then forced to hand over his upsetness and agree to acknowledge a problem with his vehicle. 

“Still locked up on yah there?”

“Yah there.”

Clark snapped a look back at Reginald as to not permit the sass.

“Here.” Clark got out and pointed at the shifter as though that would really  make for an easy scoot. 

“OH. THANKS.” Reginald slid over while grimacing. 

“Yah,” He repeated. 

Nelson was too released from the Rabbit and took a big whiff of air as he steadied himself with the hip-high roof of the vehicle. His nostrils twitched and adjusted to a wet smell grazing sensitive nose hairs he’d never trimmed for just that reason. Reggie was the first to start toward the lithic flight of stairs while scoping this coincidence for its most righteous meaning. The trio crested the cement ascension.

Clark was also in search of some meaning to fill this void, but pointing in the other direction. He was looking for the sign that said, “Stop. This doesn’t mean anything.” And in his fortune it indeed said CLOSED, on a sandwich board, and on a sign in the window, and on another sign he now noticed at the foot of the stairs. 

“There,” He pointed again. “Now get back in the car. Nelson you first.” 

“Well hold on man! It looks like there’s someone in there.” Reginald knocked at the glass door. Nelson sprang over the sandwich board to Clarks surprise. A woman came to the door. She appeared slightly disrupted but smiled on as she opened the entrance and greeted them. 

“Yes?”

“Yes. We have traveled here from many miles north and we wish to visit your library. I know you are closed today but,” he paused to see if a little cuteness would squeak out, “Even if for just a moment. We just love reading so much, you know, and we wouldn’t even take a single thing.”

“What?” Clark expressed doubt about the trajectory of his friend’s requests. She paused. It was decipherable by the upswing in her smile during this amused sort-of confusion that she perceived him to not be particularly intelligent. By that she presumed him harmless and gestured for them to pass and remained onlooking as though her judgement just could not apply to activity random as this. They stepped through the wide and solemn threshold. The ceiling began three daunting stories above them. Two balconies stuffed with shelves wrapped the circumference of the upper levels intersected by only one thin staircase. 

Clark was no longer at his seams as he strolled past the crisp ambiance of the still spines of pagination filling the room. “ANCIENT GREECE, ABNORMAL PSYCHOLOGY,” Clark’s sounded the clearly labeled arrangements that went on across the broad interior. He made haste for his most treasured reads, just for a glance. The heads of Reg and Nelson still swiveled round seeking subject-matter to plant their newest bundles of focus on. 

The titles grew broader and less clarifying as they scanned deeper into the aisles. Eventually Reginald met eyes with METAPHYSICS. He bolted toward the corner to meet the next incident in his chain. Nelson left him with dramatic silence and fell in with Clark.  Those two perused their quadrant until eventually each of them stood before an enormous canvas smothered in black, grey and maroon paint and with the lightest yellow and blue smeared over the jesso. 

“Is this for what we are here?” Nelson asked of Clark.

“For Satan? Are you scared? Nelson? Don’t you know Hel is just a Norse god anyways.” Clark nasaled out his Nordic knowledge then chuckled.

A grey demonic being with wings is sitting upon a rock in what appears to be a frigid dungeon of a long forgotten age. His left arm is reaching upward to a source of light that is just beyond the canvas. His right hand is balled into a fist and his arm is contorted over his knees to press his knuckles into the stone floor.

“At least he will return to the light.” Nelson remarks.

“What do you mean?” Clark asks.

“He’s reaching for the light. He seeks the source. He will return.”

“I don’t know.” Clark tapped his chin, “When I look at his right fist I think: This isn’t over. He will kill again!”

“HEY!” Reggie spooked, “We’ve all been to hell before.” 

Nelson jumped and simultaneously covered his head.

“I want to show you something different.” 

They followed Reginald back toward the METAPHYSICS sign which swung above them like an ancient air circulator. 

“What do you recognize?”

“Jesus.” Clark griped. “Or an alien?”

“I do not sense the answer within me.” Nelson confessed.

A single metal tube twisted precisely to form six ellipses radiating around a central point rested against a partition. 

“It’s geometry.” Reggie introduced the meaning behind this piece of craftsmanship, “And, its sacred!”

“What’s that?” Nelson asked.

“Exactly.” Clark jabbed.

“Just shut up, you non-believer!” Reggie snapped, “Sacred Geometry is what the aliens use to get around our planet. Sacred geometry is visible in plants, humans and everything. The Fibonacci sequence, ya know, can predict the weather and cellular growth, and all of that! 

“Oh! And what a Crop Circle does for a local economy is just out of this world!” Clark snarked with his fist set about his hips. 

“Gentleman!” She, their librarian, interrupted their discussion.

“Waah!” Nelson leapt up like a mouse trap and toppled just one book from the shelf. He regained equilibrium and got his hands back in his pockets. 

“The time has come for you to leave.” She gestured to the door without the previous affability. Clark glanced down at the book. I-CHING. Reggie saw the book too, and snagged it. He slyly dropped it into his pocket. Nelson simply trotted to the door. 

“You’re stealing a book from the library?” Clark whispered. 

“Do— I mean— She won’t miss it.”

“Sure you wouldn’t prefer some literature on Crop Circles, ya dick!?”  He said it again after getting interrupted the first time.

“Huh?” Reggie then shook his head.

  

  

The Reading

  

A drop of rain landed atop the cherry at the end of Reginald’s cigarette after traveling miles from its creator, neither of them knew it would happen quite like this, out like that. An unmissable grouping of clouds loomed along the horizon, a small militia of them amassing from hills only seen in the spring months of laborious revolt, rising up, finding gaps in pressure and flanking down these valleys.

Reginald tossed the half-smoked cig out into the bluster. He at last rolled the window halfway up though janky in its process. 

“Thanks for letting me smoke in your car Clark.”

“I didn’t let you smoke in my car.” Clark ran his fingers along the brim. Reginald knew it signaled something. A certain type of pout, he deemed. 

“Oh don’t be like that.” Reggie demanded, “I’m sorry I got a little short at the library, I’m just stressed. You know? You know what? You know what would calm me down? Hearing your side of the story. Yeah, yeah that’s right. That could really do us some good. Ok?” He looked at Clark who had no clear sense of what that could mean. 

“Reggie what in hell are you talking about?”

“I’m talking, Clark, about Consciousness! And how it means there’s Aliens. Don’t you know anything about Consciousness, you’re always reading this and that over there, reading up on all of it ain’t ya. Can’t you tell us a thing or two about Consciousness, Clark.”

“You ain’t takin’ one bit to my likin’ Reginald.”

“I barely know how to read Clark! I need help.”

“What? That’s not true. Is that true?”

Reggie shrugged.

“Well gee! If you’d just—” Clark paused to realize Reggie’s inner-scope could be on the dive again into some real misanthropic and tobacco sponsored torpor. Clark could see the violet and grape colors of desperation roll into the little sacks of fat under his eyes likes the begrudging clouds slipping over the vertices that composed the perniciously weathered valley.

“—She’s no good for you Reggie. She ain’t the one. There ain’t no one and only for anybody.” Clark halted and gasped for air after scraping together three sympathetic phrases, one right after the other, for Reggie. From the corner of his eye he saw his frown level out just slightly. It frightened Clark to view his warmth first hand and with that a crack of thunder “CRUUCKSSHH” and lightning burst open like a chest of treasure in the sky. 

Clark spooked right off the seat for a split second. 

Reggie burst open in laughter. 

The rain fell. 

  

Reginald saw a cluster of lights and towers and stacks of domiciles seeping outward along only the main stretches of this town just at the foothills of the up-reaches in geography. They were gathering in numbers off in the distance as they sped closer to the yellow and red shimmer as though they were descending into another galaxy. He cocked his head to the side and smiled. He waited only long enough and at last slammed on the brakes. A formidable wall of water went with the momentum after sloshing out from the puddle in the barren parking lot. 

“We’re here.”

Clark stepped out carefully to find dry land followed by Reggie then Nelson. Their movements were well synchronized now. Nelson proudly nodded at each of them during the harmony. Reggie nodded to remain in step with his psychic. They look at the wet ground that is ornamented with crinkled cans, torn backpacks, some olives and corn. The clouds clear.

“Quite the ramshackle of a shelter.” Clark started chuckling again.

“You don’t know that, Clark.” Reggie seemed to team up with the raggedly hospitable outcropping against Clark, “And what’s with that chuckle huh? And your hat. What’s with that cowboy hat?” He pointed accusingly. 

“Wuch ya mean?”

“Oh please. I knew you’d say that! Or something like that. You’re a funny guy Clark. You know that?” 

Clark twisted around and glared at Reginald right in the eye. Not between the eyes. In the eye! Eye to eye, ojo a ojo! Reginald lurches first, only six or seven seconds in. He kicks the shimmering gravel in the anguish of defeat. Clark then walks even closer to Reggie’s eyes. Ojos inches from ojos.

“Man, whatever!” Reggie steps away, arms up, mouth open and eyes lost for a purpose. Clark walks inside. He looks back once.

“So you don’t know or no one knows about your hat?”

“I can’t take it off.”

“Oh? Well, what about my stuff? A toothbrush or clothes or anything for the trip?”

“You don’t brush your teeth and you probably wouldn’t change anyway.”

“Your hat, however, made the trip.”

“You weren’t conscious. I dragged you into the Rabbit. So, go over there idiot.”

“Oh? Going there now? Idiot, you. You, you are the idiot.”

“Did you just say ‘going there?’”

“Did you just say ‘did you just say?’ And no, Idiot.”

  

  

“We should check it out then.”

“Check what out then?”

“The I-CHING.” Reggie flipped through the introduction.

“So he does read.” Clark noted.

“Broken and unbroken my-” He looked up from the book as excited as is possible when seeking Clark’s attention, “-friend. We need some coins to flip. Got any coins?”

“Oh.” He patted his thigh. 

“Do you have some?” Reggie repeated.

“No.” He lied. He did have some. He resented this fact. Clark ever-so gently slid his hands in and out of his pockets evading any jingle then swiftly showed empty palms. He did not want to play I-Ching with Reggie. 

“Hmm. What if I do this?” Reggie kicked Clark’s leg. The coins jingled. Clark plunged his hand into his pocket to repair the illusion by quickly gripping coins but spilled the rest on the grizzled carpet.

“Those coins were in your pocket. They’re on the ground and in your hand now. I can see them you selfish bastard.”

“Fine. Play.” Clark dropped the rest of the fraction of a handful of coins on the night table which was unorthodoxly placed away from the bed along a porous wall between the closet and toilet. 

“I can’t believe we’re here.” Nelson mused to himself.

Reggie snatched the coins and flipped them onto the bed.

“You count up the coins. This is 2. This is 3.” He bestowed the tail and the head to the room and proceeded to make six tosses of the coins. Broken, broken, broken, unbroken, broken, unbroken.

“So, what?” Clark gathered his change.

“I got 36.” Reggie unfolded the book for them to lay eyes on.

“36.” Nelson echoed.

“Great job?” Clark looked at Reggie as to continue denying his prior transgression regarding the coins, “So? What does it say?!” Clarks arms went up now. 

“Oh. It says ‘Darkening of the Light. You are in the intolerable position of being under the authority of forces that are contrary to your principles and beliefs. Instead of just being irrelevant, on a different plane, the underlying direction of the outside forces that direct, shape, and limit the circumstances of your life confront your own philosophy and ideology head on. There is nothing you can do to change this situation.”  

He stopped reading.

Clark chuckled.

  

  

  

  

  

  

  

  

  

  

  

  

  

  

  

  

  

  

  

  

  

  

Trans-Incidental Trifecta

  

Clark handed him the check marked sheet. Then the little pencil with a waxy exterior. It glimmered even under the pale bulbs of this strip mall suite. 

“Go.”

Nelson was given the duty of returning the items to the sharply uniformed employee behind the counter. He rolled seaweed around rice and cold fish. Nelson took a few lanky steps toward the man. Behind him a poster with all twelve animals of the Chinese calendar lined the wall between two doors. He scanned it from side to end while dropping the sheet and pencil in the man’s baskets, “Pig, dog, rooster, monkey, sheep, horse, snake, dragon, rabbit, ti- Wait. Snake. Dragon. Rabbit?”

The man rolling sushi started laughing. 

“You have never seen a calendar like this.” He quickly intuited the cause of Nelson’s extroverted curiosity and walked toward the calendar. 

“Come here.” He pointed to a spot near him on the floor. Nelson stepped into the spot. 

“What year is your birth?”

“1-9-8-7.” 

“Nineteen Eighty Seven? Yes. See there? Rabbit. And you are called?” He gestured for Nelson to answer with his name. Nelson instead stated his newfound title, 

“Psychic.” 

The man’s eyes darted from contact after his response.

“Go. Sit.” He then said to Nelson at which point an alert clicked. The man could barely withstand the creepy feeling it took to look at him and say it again while Nelson’s large a confused affect remained closely fixed on him. Nelson made one step closer. 

“Go away Rabbit.” The sushi chef affirmed his doubts and turned away.

  

“What is he doing?” Reggie nervously asked Clark at their table when he spotted Nelson now standing in the kitchen.

“What are YOU doing?” Clark reminded him.

“Where’s the sake?”

“He literally is ordering right now.”

Nelson returned to the table.

“Year of the Rabbit. Me. And you,” He pointed across to Clark, “Dragon. And you,” He turned his palm up and dipped it toward Reginald. He drew a snake. “Snake.” 

“And we,” Nelson continued emphatically, breathing through each piece of his fragile proclamation, “A Rabbit, Dragon, Snake are all above the shower in the tile mosaic back at home. Did you know this? This is it! The equation is so beautiful sometimes! We were there all along, we were there, projected by time to live there, meant there, our home, and now, here.” Nelson looked into his hands and spread his fingers with newly energized finesse, spreading, and curling, and spreading, and curling. Each finger started to move faster and then out of syncopation as they grew more obscure at each repetition.

“Nelson.” Reggie pressed. “You’re doing this because you want to, right?”

“We need to go. He’s losing it again Reggie.” Clark then passed Reg some cash. 

“We haven’t even got the Sake.”

“Reggie, pay the man!”

“And, like, the food?”

Clark stood on up and stepped toward the exit one heel at a time rocking from back to front. He opened the door. He planted his foot as a doorstop. 

“Come Nelson.” Clark commanded from the exit. Nelson brought his hands up to his face and let them continue whirling fantastical digitalizations over his eyes. His lips were now evoking a disturbing twitch as he scampered through the door. Reggie dropped the cash in the basket and as to cover for Nelson also scampered past Clark. 

  

  

They arrived back at the motel. Clark turned off the car. No one made a sound until the last incantation of the cooling engine popped out of notice. Reggie had not been wasting his time and scanned his mental-catalog of any documented abnormal behavior related to what they witnessed in the sushi restaurant. 

“It was as though he was counting something. Miles on a map or something.” Reggie finally landed on his hypothesis. They both turned to cast their concerned gaze upon Nelson. He had a similar posture with both of his hands wrenched inward like an arthritic bird with his fingers sprung up toward his dark and distant eye sockets. His eyes were pulled downward toward his fingertips and fingerprints as though his view was gripped by something much deeper within them. 

Suddenly the same fingertips began fluctuating between different patterns again, fingers up then lain flat, forming circles with thumb, pinky, index. His hands slid upward pressing on his torso and chest, and further up his shoulders and around his neck wrapping in ascension up to his face where he squeezed from both sides symmetrically contouring his jaw, nose, and ears.

“Nelson!” Reggie spoke to stay with him through these foreign and hopefully involuntary movements.

He was unresponsive. 

“Have you found them?” Reginald’s pupils dilated in excitement as he convinced himself that Nelson must have been gripped by another being, possibly extraterrestrial. 

“Can you see them Nelson? If so I can see them see through you. Can you speak to us through him. Speak to us!” Reginald interrogated this force of telepathy usurping their uniquely positioned friend however, Nelson gave him zilch.  

“If they’ve taken control of your spirit then you blink once ok. Or no! Nelson! Blink three times, yes Nelson, in triplets right?” Reggie slowed down at the end trying to peel away Nelson’s absence. 

Nelson didn’t blink. Reggie turned to Clark. 

“Has he not been blinking this whole time?”

“Reggie! You know what?” Clark sequestered Reg’s attention. He then looked right at him but said nothing while turning over the ignition. He slammed the accelerator! The front tires torqued into action! Gravel was flung to their aft like a burst of miniature comets from the rings of Saturn. He accelerated to a hair whipping pace down the highway. He took a few wide-mouthed breaths. The woods cleared into a great meadow stretching for a few miles across each side of the long thin asphalt. He began again,

“Would ya stop all this if we just—” it felt like giving in, it felt unusual as he probed the option, “—just go to the Manor. If y’all really need this kismet-babble to keep ya up on yo’ horse then fine. I don’t like saying it, but that one back there-” He pointed to Nelson who remained glued to his own face, “-needs to get it in his head that he ain’t magic! I don’t see no other way. So I’ll just show him what’s really going on in parts like that, Reggie. I’ll just show him what these people’re really like! That’ll show you too! And then I can finally take off this old dirt-bringer.” Clark flicked his hat and pulled it firm over what was left to show of his forehead. 

“Isn’t that what we’ve been doing! Clark. You’re a terrible cowboy!”

“Just say you’ll shut up and I’ll get us there.”

“You’re getting funny again. And what about our motel?”

“—If I don’t like saying it once, well I most certainly don’t like saying it again! So open your window so’more there partner cause I know ya ain’t had a wash at the motel and I know it’s tender, but those aromatics, are a real discontentment.” Clark confessed.

“So now you can’t take your hat off but I still smell bad?”

“Let’s get on outta here whiles its still early Reggie and get y’all’s trippy little doo-dah day over with. And that’s it. Can we just keep it to that there Reggie?”

  

  

  

  

  

  

  

  

  

  

  

  

  

  

  

  

  

  

  

  

  

  

  

  

  

  

The Way Inside

  

Microscopic slates of rock shatter into metamorphic oblivion under the tires, not to be seen like that again for millennia as the trio races up a trail to the manor. The surrounding trees clear and their vista opens to a several acre expansion. Peoples draped in yellow gowns dotted the descending twilight landscape. Clark’s breath quickens. 

“Nelson! You seeing your friends here?” Clark agitated Nelson who’d remained supremely silent the rest of the leg. Reggie turned back and noticed a few homes sparsely plunked into lots along the tree line. Another larger and much more complex home centered the property atop the slope. They noticed the uniformed peoples dissipating from sight as they followed each other behind the large home boasting a tumorous quality with addition after addition stretching across the green horizon. 

“Reggie grab him.”

“Nelson? What do you mean grab him?”

“Just punch him in the leg.”

“I do not want to punch him in the leg.”

“I’d punch you in the leg.”

“I know you would. That’s why I kicked you.”

“Nelson!” Clark decided to go it alone, 

“I want you to see who we found. Nelson. Peon.” 

A subsequent grouping of uniformed people emerged from the front door of the central building. 

“Peon. And the gang.” Clark said aloud and loosely respecting, “Look at these weirdos!” He then insulted. 

“Flash whizz ZANG!” Nelson reacted. He reached out and gripped Clark’s face! The hat adhered to his head as they struggled. Clark dug his fingernails into Nelson’s wrist until he peeled his clamping hand off of him. Clark knocked open the door and leapt out. Nelson climbed over the seat and un-wedged himself from the front compartment to follow while blankly looking through Clark. The hat glistened in the fading sun.

“Now, now, Nelson.”

Reggie climbed out last and looked the few yards up to the doorsteps. The group fluxed in size again with more people draped in yellow emerging from the opening. Nelson caught notice and neared them while keeping distance from Clark and Reggie. 

“Peon.” Clark said slowly, a third time.

After minutes of Nelson watching Clark and Reggie watch him approach the door he at last disappeared behind the group. The plethora of personalities veiled in obscure attitudes and normalities slipped like a school of fish back into the shelter. The door closed. Clark ran up and lunged after the heavy iron grip. He yanked in small blasts of effort. The entrance wouldn’t budge. Reggie pointed over the roof signaling a better chance to infiltrate from the other side.

“Reggie. He attacked me. Do you think—”

“—Let’s just go get him Clark.”

Reggie shuffled down the stairs and began running to the end of the building. It took Clark a moment to react as Reggie’s selfless proactivity confused him. Nevertheless he soon dashed toward the last modification in this forethought-lacking structure. He caught Reggie and they slowed to a communicable but stealthy speed. They watched the aligning of their steps.

Reggie looked up to the hat. 

“I can help you get it off Clark.” 

“I know.” Clark said only once.

They made a left around the estate. They scanned for windows and other entrances along the flank. Each was covered in canvasses stapled in excess to the sills. There were no doors. They reached the rear side of the complex. Tens of these uniformed people were outside and gathering in a mass. They would have been spotted by the posse immediately if it weren’t for the bald headed figure at the center of their entire attention. Reggie points as the ocean sunset comes into view way in the distance over tree tops. 

“Will you take a look at that?” Clark points. Reggie swats it away. 

“See down there Clark? These people will know how to meet aliens.” Reggie resumes. His brow furrowed as he looked down toward this group with determined eyes, “Here! It is here that we acquire the impossible access, alienesque access summoned here in this mysterious amphitheater, possibly this very night. It must be. It must. There is no higher probability than a milieu such as this. Look.” He pointed again. “Clark, just look.”

Clark didn’t say anything having requested precisely the same attentiveness at the start. The deeply ceremonious group far down the hill had begun somersaulting as their leader and cronies viewed from a podium. Each of them struggled to roll over themselves and over each other, nevertheless their strife succeeded in the tossing of their physicalities. It was like decoding gibberish or a word scramble of body parts and in motions no more explicable than a swarm of flies. Clark’s stomach turned as he presumed this strange exercise to have also been tainted by Peon’s more personal efforts. 

“I looked.” Clark conceded. “They’re making mud now. No aliens. Covering themselves with the mud now. Reggie. This is a genuine freaky fucking affair if you’re asking me. Reggie. You over there with any eyes?” He called for another sight confirmation as this display developed.

“Clark.” Reggie turned to Clark. Clark turned to him, hat and all. 

“No, no.” Reggie said. “I need the real Clark.” 

Clark scowled then froze as he couldn’t help acknowledging a differentiation. He let out no reaction but laid eyes, shockless eyes on him scraping in his direction as Reggie tried to wriggle free from the optical grip. In a surprising reacquisition of fervor Reggie however stated then his mission-objective with more ungrounded prescience than he ever had, 

“There it is! I will capture their corporeal animas and I will bring it, all of it, back, to her! And they!” he pointed at them, “are an integral part of it. Ok?”

“I wasn’t asking.” Clark reprised as he turned around and hastily made for the car. Hands in pockets. Reggie quickly realized his powerlessness in Clark’s strategy and chased the car down the gravel road until it came to a complete stop and he was allowed inside.

  

  

  

  

  

The Manor

  

_We pop back,_ 

_effervescently breaching the surface of time,_ 

_in a bubble so-to-imagine,_ 

_and reenter this essence_ 

_as Nelson flees their vehicle._ 

  

“—Weirdos.”

Not the least bit reluctant to apprehend Clark’s face while doing so, Nelson purged the Rabbit. He measured his strides respectfully as he solemnly pioneered the distance to his new family. He skipped up the short staircase and bound through its front door as he was ushered by the formidable welcome party. A long-awaited reunion and joyous crescendo of tele-friendly exchanges met him as though he had at last garnered the means to scuttlebutt with his most genuine astral-constituents. 

“Oh the aura!” He rejoiced. The rest of these recruits emoted similarly. A few lifted their arms over their heads and seemed to be collaborating on some orchestration in the movement of their wrists and elbows. He noticed others shifting to petting one another generously in darker enclaves of the front room. Some lowered themselves horizontally onto all fours with their laps facing out and were reaching their legs and arms for traction around other growlingly ecstatic participants. 

“Befriending with such courage!” Nelson cheered. 

The last of natural light slipped behind the sealing door and a woman appeared from a corridor above the small sea of heads under dim electric light.

“Welcome.” The woman said. She fashioned several white robes from a steel armoire that clanged abrasively enough to disperse the group to his anterior. She then passed the stack of gowns to another participant who snatched the garments from her boney hand. They took one and passed it on.

“Here we go. Ok? Here we go.” An older man next to him said.

Nelson, now robed along with the other newbs was able to scan the entire entry way. Adjacent to the hallway there was a long staircase rounding upward. The railing is a hardened flat black with wide wooden steps neatly contoured by dark red shag running up each step of the parabola to unknown quarters. In similar tone with the rest of the enclave it was detectably modified and without mastery. The paint streaked down the seams of the walls rolling over long forgotten baseboards. Nelson and the group were then suddenly intercepted by another individual who introduced herself quite formally despite the abruptness of her entry.

“I am Carbon of the Highest Valence,” she said bowing only slightly as her hands met Nelson’s. She repeated this process with each of them. 

“This way please.” She commanded, at last and politely to them. Nelson saw her hand gestures move like whispers in a meadow, ever so light as she pointed toward the first destination of their orientation. A slough of rooms lined the hall with doors littered in incoherent drawings and repetitious phrases cut out of construction paper. The wing turned and ended starkly. Again the building’s modifications shined bright as the light trickled in from plentiful gaps in the sheet rock and pithy attempts at carpentry composing this newest threshold. They were now at the last room. Carbon of the Highest Valence stood before this large door of rising doom like a canyon wall. She opened it like a priest divulging all her wicked secrets. Her lips smiled as it swung open and met the interior wall letting the novices enter for full sight of its wonder. Sopping wet robes and socks were stretched out and piled up just next to the entrance to the water. 

“What body is this?” Nelson probed. This enormous room housed a large and seemingly shallow pool of water. Nelson, along with most of the other recruits examined the chamber which was full of other members without any garments at all.

“Oh my.” His eyes went down. He had been convinced that this, was of course, to be very unlike he and his group, who he presumed more couth considering the gravitas of theirs and Peon’s potential. Nevertheless, some had already balled up and were contriving movements resembling a somersault while splaying their hind parts at each revolution. Another cluster squirmed about the slick tile slapping extremities and patellas and shin bones and other parts as they pressed together until disappearing back under the water. They managed to repress any verbal noise in doing so; though their motion was constant and nude.  

“These are the shallow pools of deep insides,” their pleasant host Carbon informed them. Nelson realized it was indeed more than one pool. There were three of them. Nelson also realized his teammates had completed divesting themselves of their any article of cover. 

“Why are they removing their clothes?” It jarred Nelson as he asked though without avail. This confusion intensified. And changed. It changed into another feeling, a feeling he seldom disquieted for certain fear, for deep constraining fear of what overwhelming mystery and pathos inducing failure loomed ahead.

  

_And with that,_ 

_before dipping entirely_ 

_into this provocative social scape,_ 

_let us rewind_ 

_our temporalities even further,_ 

_through backsides of moons and myriad of solar flings_ 

_to an afternoon when Nelson himself had been provoked_ 

_into a comparable trajectory of bonding_ 

_with a young woman, human._ 

  

She, initially by the name of Morjava and precisely in line with his most popular export, found Nelson irresistibly cute upon the first and second gaze. “Like a mother fucking bunny rabbit.” She had reported to the girls. His non-judging globulous eyes, his tender and uncoordinated kiwi-sized joints and over-vertical lack of chest muscles were indeed tractor beams of sexuality unto her femininity roiling with impurities upon each of their randomized run-ins. Nelson, like a forest creature spotted while strolling through the woods, or the first snowflake of a blizzard landing on one’s dry wrist, or just a leaf blown in by a neighbor’s 2-stroke tidying up the street, again appeared unscheduled in her café. She smiled at him and the fortuity of his surprise arrival. 

“More java please.” He held a sustainable cup before her. He kept his hood up and cinched. 

“More java? That must be my name from now on.” She sighed. 

“Morjava?” Nelson condensed.

“What’s your name?” She turned. At last her lasso of glee and hype whirled out to retrieve the apple of her eye and its name.

“Nelson?” His tone ascended without clarifying ballast.

“Nelson?” She replayed the noise for him in kindness and fondness for shyness; and the wavy little hairs curling out from his overly washed cotton hoodie hood. Her story, her lasso, her checkboxes undulated also in ascension, rising like a stormy tide of curiosity for this hot mystery that had meandered into her grips. She slid him a small cup of java.

“Much appreciated Morjava.” Nelson stated believingly.

“Cassandra. Haw!” She laughed. 

“My name is Cassandra. You goof! Haw! Haw!” She laughed two loud and unhooked bellows. A hint of her mother’s verbosity resonated through both of them. This gave her pause. However, with a few graceful and shiny blinks she resumed the acquisition.

“It’s so,” she paused again- “fun of you, to come in, after hours, like this, Nelson. What are you thinking about?” She narrowed her word choice while oblivious to Nelson himself being oblivious to her objectives, as well as the café closing an hour ago. He sipped his java. 

“This is very hot.” He observed.

“Like?” She intimated. He didn’t budge. “Say, friend,” Her eyes tipped upward like a land developer might do as they enter into their closing power-point presentation. 

“Do you want to go for a walk with me?” She posited a continuation of their interaction then connected with his eyes. 

“Not yet.” Nelson again delivered what appeared to be deliberate fraternization to embellish her playfulness. 

“Oh? Take your time.” 

He sipped for another temperature reading, twice, then a third time without saying a single thing mouth-wise or in any medium of cunning eye-glances to promulgate his feeling about this suspense. He just sipped. 

“So…” 

She attempted to reinvigorate her company after this brash silence and after having inverted the last chair but was interrupted by the jingling bell dangling on the front door. 

“Oh hey Cass! Didn’t think you’d still be here?” 

The boss walked in. He halted. He, male, fancy-shirted with a fulfilled line of buttons running all the way up his gut and under the half pound of flab gathered by the collar’s unnatural pinch, was taken aback by the hooded lingerer.

“Who’s this?”

“Nelson?” She fired back then winked at Nelson who kept still.  

“Who?” The boss pried.

“We’re going.” She tossed an apron on the counter that she’d rolled up while sifting through this bitey trouble shooting. It slid, ricochet’d twice and stopped precisely atop the POS system. She clutched his hand, reached for her bag and pulled both of them out of the café at last. 

  

  

“Nelson. You’re the best.” She tried to gaze into his magically empty eyes while he took again to his staple brew. He hadn’t missed a sip as they strode down the damp sidewalk with Keds and Cons splashing in the puddles accentuated by floating contraception, needles and little baggies. It caused something in her. Something only met by this maturity, something sturdily seductive in his well-worn quietude. 

“You’re quiet. I like it.”

“I…” Nelson stopped there while looking at her in the summer light as an otherwise invisible layer of frizz appeared woven through the bright sky around her casual yet splendid silhouette. Nelson’s eye lids drooped which let out a certainly novel euphoria as the moment that strung them together laid there for later retelling. 

“Come over.” She touched his arm.

“She touched his arm.” Bloopered from Nelson’s mouth. 

“You know what? Let’s, check, out, your place!” A smooth pivot away from her housemates. “Haw! Yeah. Let’s go Nelson!”

  

They went. 

  

He failed. 

  

_Let us jump across_ 

_that mess_ 

_and rejoin post caress_

_as she finds herself settling the recoil_ 

_of young Nelson’s botched intimacy_

  

“Well, that looks like it’s a lot of semen.” She whispered inspiringly and giggled quietly while softly grazing his sweatshirt with her nails. 

“Sorry.” 

“Sorry? Don’t say sorry. It’s ok but, sad isn’t sexy Nelson.” The s’s streamed out of her voice like teensy waterfalls spilling out his embarrassment, pure and cold like mountain springs.

She heard an unnatural low noise burst from under his moppish do. She pulled herself over his shoulder and peered into his eyes.

“Nelson.”

  

“Nelson. No crying.”

  

“Nelson. It happens.”

She now stood in his doorway. She turned. She stepped out to the porch and caught eyes with the dapper Clark who held a cigarette between his fingers. 

“May I have one of those?” She managed to ask politely.

“I don’t smoke.”

“You’re a dick.” Quickly she retorted the liar’s clear fallacy.

“Here’s one.” Reginald stepped out from under their porch. He put one between her fingers and pulled his cig from Clark’s talons. 

“And you are?”

“Not believing my eyes.” Reginald spontaneously completed in pure extroverted awe of stunning Cassandra, and in comparison with the wavering Nelson. 

“I mean— Reggie?”

“Haw— I mean thanks for the cigarette. Creep?” She bested in response to the usual ogling. She stepped from the wooden stairs and sunshine into the comfortable tree cover.   

“What’s your name?” He sounded as she fled.

“Morjava.”

  

  

_We return._ 

  

Nelson fled the proposition to join in with the drenched pullers and nuzzlers shimmying into their new near-bodied roles, even as mere orientees. His focus instead came back to Carbon who uniquely still wore her robes while standing before them. He stood out too from the group by asking her a question. 

“And what is the wisdom gained here in the shallow pools of deep..?” 

“Insides.” She beamed, “Here we learn of our primordial contact in a way that every squirm, flop and dare I say rumpy pumpy present an opportunity to be delivered from suffering by the ‘why not’ of reality and merge back with the movement of our original composition in the prehuman, primordial and nutrient-filled seas of planet earth, sloshing about the trenches and shelves of cooling aquatic climates in epochal measure, frothing with life through whirlpools and super-currents away from the core into fecund sprays unto the sky. Yes, to answer your question it is here that we have first contact. As he states, we must serve and honor our lower-being—,” 

She gestured below her belt and winked blatantly lacking finesse, 

“—to achieve the highest consciousness. Peon’s belief is: the more time exploring and nurturing your first contact, the more momentum one has to release when tapped into the realms beyond. He says we may even be able to reach his realm.” 

She pointed up to the blotchy ceiling.

“And, yet,” Nelson continued with his line of interest, “you still wear your robes unlike those, and of course those over there, and of course these here having intercourse, as they say.”

“Well you, curious my incurious as we need all see are stepping out of your boundaries by asking about this garments unlikely as that may appear to be in this setting. Carbon then made an about face and marched.

“You are special.” Nelson espoused. He and the rest of the nudes continued in her path along the edge of the pools to a door which gave way to a large atrium. Everyone became still after filing in and after many others joined from the pools and other inlets of this compound. Most re-robed. Others were in shirts, gowns, drapes, and curtains. It was clear the organization of the clothing rested solely on size and bleakness in hue. Nelson peered around in the silence washing over him that like the air he breathed itself was mute. He caught movement at the perimeter of the crowd in the corner of his eye.

“A gesture, a wish, a tap into—”

Just over shoulders he could see petite Carbon, even more layered in garments than before. She reached for the handle. She rattled the door in jolting fury. 

“—Dear pluralities up and up and high away, hiding away in palatial interior decor! Will it be that they, Peon and his Sorceress, are ready for us?” She chorused from under the muting of armpits and torsos. 

“ZZZAAAIII” Carbon suddenly screamed!

Nelson didn’t jump. He had caught himself. He had stayed himself. He examined his forearms in awe and looked back at Carbon. And she at him.

  

  

  

  

  

  

  

  

  

  

  

  

  

  

  

  

  

  

  

  

  

  

  

  

  

  

  

  

  

  

  

  

  

  

  

Nuclei

  

  

“Tender Nelson lands among Peon and his strangers. How becoming.” Their stout and nearly located friend Aggy said while lighting a small joint completed in less than a minute. His garage reeked of gasoline, weed and salt water. He already had apologized twice defending certain existence of his higher habits. A surfing magazine placed for preparing joints sat on a plush orange ottoman which had been dragged into the task of centering their discussion. Plenty of extra marijuana grounds were strewn along the cover underlining the featured Tierra del Fuego. Aggy saw Clark looking at the highlight, 

“One of the most ridiculous waves ever surfed right there,” He said holding his breath and pointing with the lit joint to the magazine.

The smoke seeped out of his lips until they broke open.

“King of it all! Ridiculous.” Aggy said the word again, slowly, and for reverence rather than ridicule. He then passed the joint to Clark who reluctantly pinched it between his digits. 

“Puff or pass it muchacho” Aggy purports.

“No drugs.” He concludes while extending his arm back.

“Hey man! Pass that dutchy on the left-hand side man!” Reggie snatched the marijuana cigarette from Clark. 

“All right. Cowboy. No drugs. I thought cowboys liked drugs? Wasn’t it a bore crossing plains with a legion of cattle?”

Clark remained still and quiet while the room filled with contour lines suggesting a map of previously unforeseen patterns in the ineffective air-circulation of the garage. His hat broadly held their easily entertained minds while the smoke-whirl decayed from the blown pace. 

“Your hat?” Aggy rolled a soda swiftly across the tangerine furniture that he manifested from a cooler with his rap-rock phase adhered to each side. Silence filled the smoky space. His tone changed when it clicked he was being ignored. 

“Just another cowboy then.” Aggy retreated. 

Clark cracked open the pop and guzzled it down a good ways. Some droplets were sent dribbling south of his jaw and neck. 

“He can’t take it off.” Reggie ratted.

The smoke rolled further up into the rafters full of surfboards, specialized duffle bags and bandoliers of velcro awaiting to be revivified. Aggy reached forward to devise a second cone. And as he rolled he spoke. 

“Clark. I know you. I know you won’t admit a thing. Sometimes.”

Aggy, masterfully, had already completed wielding the herb into geometric form whilst entering discourse with Clark. He went for the incendiary device. Clark reached as well. His free fingers rushed past.

“Clark.” Aggy reframed. Clark nabbed the lighter. 

“Clark, if you can’t get the hat off, that means it’s a bandage. It’s still healing.” He then yanked the light right back out of his fist. He lit his dear paper tube. He coughed once. Aggy then slurped hard like a milkshake on his joint. His lips reddened as the handicraft rumpled from the pressure. He treated this one as his alone, still, however, Reggie awaited a portion. He was even quiet with patience as gobs of fume advanced from the torched herb into the garage by way of his wrinkled brow.

“ClarKA-KA-WA-WA” Aggy suddenly began coughing loudly. Exponentially more rambunctious seizes of noise lurched out from his lungs, gurking spastically like old motorcycles with fresh tanks. He stood up, “RAB RAB RAB” he went on and on deepening each expulsion like a great dig until Reggie had enough.

“AGGY!” Reggie ignited. 

Aggy waved his joint through the air like a surrender then shifted to more of a stabbing motion.

“It’s a bandage.” Aggy softly retrieved his point.

“Ok. Cool.” Reggie chimed back in also at a smoother level; but kept eyes on the joint like a young hound does a chicken bone all supper long. He suddenly pooched his craving. “Can I have some more?”

Aggy ripped on his magnificent and fully presented leisure. Two-thirds had already been vacuumed right out of it. Aggy set the wrapped and tar-gooed ganja on the ashtray though without any oral specificity as to what should happen to it next. The plumes rolled over Clark’s shoulders like storms over the Sierra Nevadas on down through the rugged back country over yonder with the yard picks, torn fishing nets and jugs of gasoline.  

Reggie snatched the joint decidedly from the blooming ashtray and looked around with a smile.

“Now what kinda’ diagnosis are you smackin’ about there Aggy?” 

“A bandage. Whenever you’re ready, it’ll come right off. I’m sure of it. It’s a metaphor Clark. You like those metaphors don’t ya?”

Clark ran his tongue across his front teeth as an instinctive alert of doubt pushed up from the back of his throat. His chin butted forth. He stopped himself from saying somethin’ surly and let the rest of the foul breath fall out of his mouth. 

“I say,” Clark deduced, “I do.”

“See? You like metaphors. And Reggie? Metaphors?”

Clark wouldn’t give and stole back the digression, “AND! SO! You were saying about all that metaphorin’?” He pressed.

“I do. Like metaphors.” Reggie looped in. 

“I’m sayin’ it’s a metaphor.” Aggy answered redundantly.

“The metaphoring is a metaphor itself?”

“Yeah man and the Aliens man! And Aggy, you’re good. You are so good! To me! And here I give you back this beautiful weed snorkel my good friend.” Reggie interrupted. 

“You are on drugs.” Clark surmised.

“No, no, no, you are great! And this drug? This drug is great.” Aggy now tried to synopsize for them all, “And you? You are great. I did that intentionally, repeating myself there, and there too, but, because, I am high and great, too. And you are great. Clark?” 

Aggy burst out with a deep and obnoxious ripple of mirth, “Buhaha.” He attempted to entice Clark by wiggling it in his face, then tried the stabbing motion. Clark’s eyes rose above the cloud and connected with Aggy’s curious as to how this same proposition could have reanimated in a matter of minutes. 

Despite clear bounds, Reggie’s bright skull brimmed with possibilities while his eyes widened asymmetrically. The temptation, too, to pester Clark hooked. He shouted at him.

“DOOO IT!”

“No. YA DOOSH!” Clark reapplied.

“Ok. This.” Aggy signaled something new with his finger. “Then Aliens?” Pointing inconclusively toward Reg, “Then we—.” 

“—This what?” Clark declared his mood at last grumpy as their words pushed together.

“The metaphor. The other metaphor!” Aggy at last made some clarity for them.

“The other metaphor?” Reggie followed.

“Nessie. My wife Nessie. She is at Peon’s camp, too. That’s the metaphor. The other metaphor.”

“WHAT!?” Clark went vacant for a proper side of the hearsay to run from, “That’s not a metaphor,” he mustered, “That’s a…” he fell silent searching for accuracy.

“With Nelson? Wait. Who is Nessie?” Reginald breathed quietly.  

“Who is Nessie? Are you joking?” Clark whacked at Reggie who pulled at the ashtray nervously as his show of guilt quaked out to feed Clark’s wrath.

“She lived with us Reggie! We all lived together Reggie! You, me, Nelson, Cass, Aggy and Nessie.” Clark replayed their residential history for him while pointing to Aggy.

“I. Remember. Now.” Reggie coughed out, embarrassingly.

“He drinks so much.” Clark complains to Aggy who was reloaded with another of his own vice. 

“He’s a social guy Clark. Meets a lot of people you know? You do remember though? My dear Nessie?” He asked flexibly of Reggie. 

“Yes!” Reggie shook his head, “I totally remembered her. I was just kidding. Haw!” He let out a similarly defensive laugh to that of his lost lover.

“Oh.” Aggy paused while being forced to call bullshit internally. He recalled that sound.  

“That reminds me. How’s Cassandra Reggie? How could I have forgotten her?”

“She left. Well, really I left. That’s why we’re here. To find an alien or multiple.”

Aggy leaned forward, “Aliens.” He stated specifically without connotation.

“You see, the guy Peon can make, uh, I don’t how to say this but, Nelson is psychic and he’s getting guidance from Peon.” Reggie informs.

“On super-orgies?”

“What?”

“Peon is some kind of sex guru. You’ve seen the films. He’s up there fornicating with the masses, and my wife. Reggie, my friend, it’s a metaphor.”

“Well this Peon that Nelson met is psychic. He’s like, uh what’s it, channeled from another reality.” Reggie laid down firmly.

“There’s probably only one Peon, Reggie.” Aggy presented ever so gently, “But Nessie,” he broke up spontaneously like a frayed wire on the CB. “Oouuuuh!” He suddenly burst into a scathing howl like a senile dog during supper, “Hooooo” A morsel of phlegm even sailed up from his charred larynx onto the tip of his lip. Quieting down then, he wiped it with one tissue he delicately pulled from a whole box of tissues placed next to the cooler. Reggie and Clark noticed it simultaneously. 

“You can learn from him.” Clark suggested for Reggie. 

“I was doing fine. I just—”Aggy’s eyes began streaming clearly.  

“Need a ride?” Clark bowed his head.

Night Shine 

  

They left at the behest of Nessie and Nelson’s involvement with Peon. Peon’s sphere of influence grew with this news of their friend’s interconnectivity. That they felt while climbing back into the car one person at a time. Back out on the winding highway, the obfuscating night shined just pockets of moonlight at intervals only intuited by the swirls of cloud cover. Aggy’s lighter sparked sporadically as he had prepared more than several joints for the trip burning three, four, five up and over familiar hills encompassed by this hemisphere’s turn to be pointed out to sunless space.  They rolled into the ranchy amalgamation of shelter and shrine. All but one light was out as Clark powered-down the Rabbit, and the only visible appendage to the property remained the long gravel route spilling out from the voiceless trees that bedarken the premises’ edge. 

“Now THIS is where you get abducted!” Reginald examined.

“Oh no.” Aggy, sitting up front, rolled down his window and climbed through the passenger-side hatch refusing to get out of the car, as he stated, “Like a damned clown.” Clark got out without a word. He left the seat back enclosing Reggie. The loose old door swung shut, without him. Reginald took this as another diss against his hotly desired ET as he watched them walk off, without him. He pretended not to care, to himself, with the collecting of his forearms while still belted into the aft of the road machine. He noticed the conundrum that logically followed: “if having to act out one’s own apathy, now even to myself, maybe, this means I really do care.” This alerted him that he must re-power his tele-contraption. He connected the gizmo to the vehicle’s source of electrical current. Yet again he is struck with his dependence upon Clark. However, he couldn’t get past the dismissive behavior Clark had just exuded. So, he reverted to avenging these transactions.

“Suck it.” He commanded of the telephone in its perceived retrieval of the properly ionized loop. His head fell back. He closed his eyes and searched for the most jagged path to equanimity between he and cowboy.

  

Aggy and Clark walked to the door and light. He pounded at the barrier with the fatty side of his fist, thrice, hunching on its futility. No action from the other side. Aggy reached in his pocket as to pull out his contraption though his hand came back without the gadgetry. Clark followed mirror-like by retrieving his own pocket-computer, though without intention. He halted the cue-dependency. 

“Could you call? Her?” Clark gently put the idea before him while swiftly sliding his phone back in place.

“Shit.” Aggy began patting himself and twirling about with eyes going round like a dirt-devil. He then stopped, just as starkly as he began. 

“It’s at the house. Next to the weed. Shit.” Aggy concluded.

“Here.” Clark ruptured the pocket again. His apparatus integrated before them. He waited for Aggy’s cue.

“What? I don’t know her number.”

“Well…” He left an intended gap. 

“I mean,” Aggy’s arms went up with Clark’s implied critique. 

“I should.” He conceded without finesse. The arms went down and he went on, “We’re all just a piece of code, these days.”

“Pa’tner of the year. You got some luck though boy. I have it.” Clark chided

“You’re an idiot,” Aggy contacted his eyes, “but, thank you.” Clark’s eyes recoiled and ventured back down to his device. It died. 

“Well.” He tried to patch their demise, “Often, I enjoy my phone dying.” 

“What great techne comes to betray us next? Where is my sword!” Again Aggy’s great arms went up, and down as his great voice boomed. He retrieved another joint from the pocket vacant of the phone. He ventured to do the stabbing motion again, and again! Then lit the minuscule torch.

“Let us go.” 

Clark pointed further into the obscure acreage counter to the light down the shy and long grade to barracks of the supposedly sex-ready battalions of comers from conceivably anywhere. They marched and turned beyond reach of the lamp or ember, beyond any twinkle from the distant moon, where they placed each foot before nothing as their eyes grappled with a darkness floating stubbornly, an utterly guarded and blurred splice of nature found only at the very edge of sight. And in this murky absence hovering before them time and space waited lightless without waver, like depths of alpine lakes with only the cold blooded who roam there, when suddenly, a light flashed! The glint refracted into his eye just as he could see they were descending the broad spine of the knoll. 

“Hold!” Clark clacked at a high whisper with a fist in the air. 

“No! I shan’t heed your ill-ranked command!” Aggy refused to align as such. He puffed his rogue puff and strode faster nearly barreling through Clark. To thwart his mutinous veer however, Clark swatted Aggy’s timpani of a chest with force to hamper. He held his prostrated palm there. 

“Good God man! You must wait!”

“She is near!” Aggy cried out. The doob fell to his side. “She is penetrated by them. As them. Like them.” His wide neck rolled to Clark, “The metaphor.”

“No it ain’t so, Aggy. You just ahead of yourself now boy.” Clark denied intending to soothe while displacing an urge to disambiguate Aggy’s use of a simile. Aggy struggled again causing a slip of Clark’s palm over his breast. Clark released his hand placement and let it slide over his shoulder powerlessly as Aggy paced away. He turned to the shelters even more simple than before as there distance lessened. He saw a spartan antithesis of their beach-boheme lifestyle, drab, bare and amputated for the reduction of soul and passing on of only rawness. There were fishladder-like developments of adjacent dwellings displaying blandness like that of the public cement set aside for unlucky salmon runs, adjectively deflavorized and botched substitutions for nature’s pathways. 

“Dear man! Just know this here from me!” Aggy suddenly roared to Clark from under the tears, “Do not look, for I do believe a Medusa of sex-organs awaits. Not any soul need bear a sight as such without a generous shield to keep from leaving wounded so heartily and beguiled so eternally. Do not heed the dirty moan of the attendees, though it may populate a vessel or thousands but it will stave virtue and spread through your sense of covetousness like a rash of ivy in every intimate thought! Heed not these sapiens’ begetting and if necessary plug one’s nose even with one’s eyes. AND Thusly dear soldier, Fuck not around in here. Do you hear? With vigor we shall be celibate and fear not this zenith of missed opportunity!”

Clark gave a loyal and solemn nod.

  “Although, don’t you think you’re aggrandizing a tinge on that great grass, Aggy?” 

“No.” He positioned.

Aggy’s drumming speech had, however, stopped Clark in the very greenery he first witnessed the people dragging along in draping yellow uniforms. 

“We must move onward Aggy!  Cover more ground!” Clark hastened. 

They stepped like coyotes, like slinking canines lacking any compass but a nose, down the grade nearly blind through the grass shuffling further by the stammering will of their legged inertia into each stem and blade of the green itchy stuff until the flash reappeared.

“Get down! Someone’s out there.” Clark relayed a few yards back up to Aggy. His waddle continued in rebellion again until he stopped after coming upon an obstacle. He reached down. 

“Clark! It’s crystal!”

“Who’s Crystal?” Clark whispered sharply. 

Aggy lifted an impressive slab of shiny spiked stone up from the thickening reeds just past where Clark had crouched. His arm muscles rearranged as he demonstrated it at eye level for a good gander like a fresh caught tuna. Another blast of moonlight refracted into Clark’s eye. 

“That?” Clark found himself sore on how to rationalize the appearance of this massive nocturnal gem as he tipped his hat down.  

“They recharge in the moonlight.” Aggy pointed out to the sky then dropped the crystal.

“They? They it?” He pointed at the culprit which now showed its more abrasive and less shiny side. 

“The crystals. Do not do this with me Clark. They’re healers.” 

“What?” 

“Clark. Crystal Therapy is real. When you love somebody—”

“—Another Metaphor?”

“A metaphor or anything at all to love, to love that somebody.”

“Well,” Clark scoffed, “maybe that means I don’t really love anyone.” Clark emoted unvictoriously. 

“I love you.” Aggy offered to his emotionally parsimonious friend.

“I—” Clark stopped, shook his head.

“No? Not even a solitary word of love? Love. Love I, even, my greatest foe.” He held the peace sign up to the big house while coasting up to his bulky laugh “BRAHAHA” that was succeeded by a whimper “ooohoooo.” He then looked more clearly than he had thus far at the shelters.

“They are empty! Oh no Clark!” Aggy’s grand arms widened from his waist at the vacant sight.

“To the big house.” Clark directed. 

“Then SAY IT and we shall go. I love you Clark. Now say it to me.”

“—Not saying it.”

“So, you really must not love anyone, at all. What a draw. What a power.”

Clark stood without a word extolled, and by the psychical laws governing dually his elasticities and his inflexibilities to not only turn down the affectation, he felt within reason to leave the interaction altogether. His hands found some cotton holsters sown above his hips and he doted back over the bump of land. 

  

  

Reginald as it seemed by the stench looming in the car’s cabin had fallen asleep and relaxed, as it went, to let out a cacophony of aerosolized human-biome. 

“That. Is. Fucked.” Huffed through Clark’s palm-covered mandible. 

“Reggie?” Reggie didn’t move. The stagnancy of his hyper-active character seemed askew. 

“Reggie!” Clark piped again, alas he did not stir. 

Clark sat down at the helm, face cupped.

Reggie’s device sat at the center of their vessel with the power cord winding forth to the battery source. Clark pulled at the cable hoisting the device in the air by the line snared to its foot like a slow mouse. He then turned it right side up unveiling its brightness and micro-chipper intuitions. He unplugs the power-port’s benefactor.  

He glanced back to Reg, no movement. Slyly, he pulls open Reggie’s contacts and peruses a list of individuals in search of Nessie or some semblance. Most of these titles consisted of misspelled adjectives pertaining to the very second the person was introduced along with their cigarette preference, all until The Old Man scrolled into sight. 

“Reggie’s still got his number?” Clark asks of the spendy glass plate. 

A memory then flashed before his mind’s eye.

  

_And with the lighting of those dusty ol’ synapses_ 

_we depart this current temporality_ 

_to be injected with narration of key minutia_ 

_from the pasts_ 

_of our beloved protagonists._

  

Reginald had acquired and saved the number as such eons ago after dinner and a movie that was generously purchased by this Old Man himself. They walked out onto the street biting back on the cold rain. Droplets were crystallizing as they swooped down nearly horizontal creating inconvenient little collisions upon their lamp-lit faces. Clark pulled his phone out with miscalculated force and flung it right out of his own hand. It dunked into the urban crick amassing at the curb. 

“Fuck.” Clark said flatly, sarcastically, caustically, almost glad for its death and certainly right in front of The Old Man. He had heard of this, this sense of no-telephone and wanted to enjoy it. 

“Fuck it. Just get fucking Reginald’s number and I’ll fucking get back to you tomorrow morning.” A cussy daemon in Clark concluded to his father.

“Oh what a great idea. Nevertheless, I probably won’t fuck it—” The Old Man dead-eyed the son, “—Not buying another phone either.” 

The Old Man defied all customs to postpone embarrassing fragilities between father and adult-son and instead bestowed them before his friend. A clinched hand landed at the base of his neck like an anchor dropped on deck. 

“The phone. Clark.” 

He reached down. Nevertheless it was ruined and another plan was in order.  Digits, symbols, identities, little rubber buttons back then, were subsequently punched in and saved.

  

_We return to Clark, without motion from Reggie._

  

“Dead.” Dawns on him.

His fingers then scramble for keys dangling in the ignition. He turns. Dead. He tried again. The car whinnies for help like it were trapped in a well. 

“Are you fucking kidding me! DEAD?”  Clark shouts and twists round to Reggie, SLAP, SLAP, SLAP! Clark smacked the side of Reggie’s think-ball. A plume of dust arose from unimpressive timetables of not washing. He budges not.

“Get up! You fucking fucked us fucking dude.” 

He stirs not. 

“AAH!” Clark sprang out of the car clasping his hamstring after a surge of cramps hit from contorting himself to slap Reggie in the back seat. 

“Fuck that. Fuck him.”

Clark remarked as he set out back over the hummock. The door fell shut. His strides lengthened and hurried in precise relation with the argumentativeness that propelled him that way. He strode as such until a deranged tune of an ululating sort caught his ear. He dropped down out of sight as he strategized before and wondered if the sexees had rediscovered their dormitories, were having at each other and hence emitting this disturbing pitch riding the night air. Promptly, Clark heard again, and without any doubt, a disquieting voice sailing through the rare night from over the land. 

He chose to rise. He summited a yet-to-be-trespassed portion of the property approaching the anterior of the complex and saw again his friend, past roommate, partner or possible physical entry into the newest confluence of sex and pseudo-science, supine in the grass. He cried out another deathly drawl. 

“CRYYYSTAAAL!” he sang in riffs of this curdling agony.

Clark ran to him.

“Crystals! They are everywhere! Do not remove your shoes!” He informed as Clark caught on that Aggy had been injured at the foot. It bled. 

The simplistic and pre-modern sandal design Aggy sported had depreciated in utility in a new sprawl of land which had crystals scattered about it like mulch, like wood chips in the grass. The previous glints certainly did not compare to the sight before their eyes. The moon, full as the roundest wooden wheel had appeared for another stint. It sparkled the copious minerals so brightly Clark noticed they were where he and Reggie had witnessed the people corral and listen to Peon. He caught sight of a long table. 

“This wasn’t here before. They must be making something.” Clark examined. The crystal speckles and shavings found their epicenter around this great slab of wood on legs. 

“My foot, beloved Clark, it bleeds impaled as such!” Aggy reacquainted Clark with his urgency. “Crystal therapy carries with it danger, too.” 

  

  

Back at the Rabbit mischievous Reggie took his time to flick open his hood along with his eyes after Clark’s final lamentation. The gassing had prevailed, though the recharging brought on a latent consequence. He sat up and pulled his hood back over head and snatched his phone and a beer he’d snagged from Aggy’s cooler. He clambered out of the vehicle on all fours down the hill away from the house and light. With phone in hand, he is met by the contacts as provided by Clark. The Old Man it reads. A different idea cropped up in his head. Reggie continued crawling toward the trees even faster as it rang. 

“Reginald?” A voice demanded. 

  

  

Clark released the crystal from Aggy’s foot like a lodged chunk of reef. Blood spattered on the green and translucent ground. Clark dusted and blew off the remaining crystal from the wound. He tore a sleeve of his shirt and wrapped it round Aggy’s foot. He returned the sandal to his toes avoiding the meaty gouge.

“I am solemnly convinced dear mate. You do love me.” Aggy purported.

“We must find them. Her. And him.” Clark clarified. “The car is dead. Reggie is to blame. He doesn’t have Nessie’s number either.” Clark updated. “So, we need a jump.” 

“Yes. A jump. A jump on this we shall pray for unto the mightier forces that be. The forces that will! Oh force of forces what sacrifice doth we bestow to acquire such a jump.”

“Sacrifice?”

“Aye! Great Clark! It is only sacrifice that will bond us! Sacrifice is the eternal fuel  o’ love great Clark! Woozy as it may find me.”  

Clark turned back to the table. Then back to Aggy. 

“Up!” He mandated. “Get up now!” 

“Won’t you lend me your grip.” Clark clasped Aggy’s broad wrist and lifted him to his legs. They shared shoulders and made another trip back to the vehicle. 

“It does not appear to be occupied great Clark.”

“Fucking hell then!” Clark apprehended. “Did he run off? He’s run off! I’ll get that doggie!” Clark shouted out into the night. He propped Aggy all the way back to the front seat of the car. They huffed and spat like jocks back for the season opener. 

“Ok.” Clark plotted forth while leaned over having his breath. “Retrieve.” He straightened his back and looked off into the distance. He glanced once more at Aggy whose delirious affect enabled his leaving behind. Clark stepped out toward the trees along the gravel. 

“Could be anywhere. But why? Just to hide? No, no. That can’t be all of it.” 

Clark stepped quicker now knowing the typical ground density and having worn toe covering shoes. He reached the trees and stepped in. 

Sure enough. Across the driveway, in the other trees, drinking a beer. 

“Fucky-fuck you Reggie! When’d you get a beer!” Clark shouted with such rage his words rolled into new never before heard words. “I’m spit-raging-m’fucking mad! Mad like AND AS FUCK REGGIE!” 

Clark ran out into the gravel to cross over to that next patch of trees. 

Two lights then beamed from down the driveway bend! 

Clark stopped. 

Reggie started running.

“Reggie!” Clark saw him go, moving only with spurts of coordination like a drunk raptor through the branches. Clark led his target and accelerated. He heard the gravel crunching behind and getting closer as he sprinted. 

MEEP!

The horn blew. He dove out of the way of the car into Reggie. He tackled him to the ground. The hat remained on Clark’s head as they rolled through the grass. They heard the car turn off and door open with the headlight bell dinging. Clark and Reggie separated.

“The hat stayed on!” Reggie lauded as Clark reached out to slap him two more times. Long shadows of their scuffle cast out across the field by the truck’s hi-beams. The beer spilled into the grass as The Old Man appeared above them. 

“The Old Man!” Zapped out of Clark. 

  

  

  

  

  

  

  

  

  

  

  

  

  

  

  

  

  

  

  

  

  

  

  

  

  

  

  

  

  

The Orgy 

  

“Come down purple signal of invitation! Run true and be telling!” she bellowed, “Betwixt our toes and feet and strange modalities of movement. Come under us purple powers! Let us be undermined by you and lifted and floated up to meet them. Are she and he ready? ZAAAAIIIIII” 

She cried out again and yanked. Out from under that great door a river of red ran out, a red viscous liquid seeped every which way as it dispersed from the long slit. She opened it entirely as the crimson slid between their feet and toes and under the heels of each of them. The thin layer sprawled out until it met the very edge of the large atrium and poured into cracks where the foundations met each other. 

“We will now ascend.” Carbon described in the aftermath of this new coloration. She turned. She pointed and her blatant goofiness appeared again. The mighty group followed her motion and gained its energy all at once. They stepped rapidly up stairs just past this threshold; the stairs running red, carmine and crimson. It was not purple. 

“This is not purple.” Nelson conjectured to Carbon as he passed her and other assistants pouring red paint down the steps. He saw also, beneath the maroon liquid a large splat of the yellow from before. He looked to her again. She remained silent. The rest of the members in this cultivation of community entered a singular yet extraordinary room running the entire upper level of the structure. At one end there is a stage with lights, and the other a large wooden slab on legs, all bisected by a large chandelier. 

They filed in. Many took on their presumed proximities and positions with one another. The quickness of this place-finding routine was a bit much for Nelson. 

“A bit much.” He humbled aloud and made for the side of the room careful to avoid the nice people. Peon and his Sorceress took to the stage. A small PA was brought to them as the lights adjusted. At last it was truly purple light covering the characters on stage. They dimmed the chandelier as the taller woman handed Peon his wireless head-set while customizing her own fit. They turned to each other, then unsheathed swords checkered with crystal shining gorgeously in the purple light, and certainly accenting the red paint. 

They spoke: 

“We great ones have let you in to become as us and never us as you, we have seen enactments in bare forms and now comes time for the full extrapolation. I once was like you, beneath the paint and boundlessly denuding but I have risen out of that phase elite and fledged fully here with my being whose name I forsook while trapped in all this that becomes just a past, a wasted past. In my initial naming I was betrayed. And to undermine the curse it bestowed, the naming that is, I have found the most feasible means of calling my originality to the surface which inductively I’ve discovered to be produced of its own cause. However, there is one speck, a speck among motes, a crumb among bums, a mind and soul so small it’s blinding! Him, it, there, you know, Peon. He has shown me, and now it finds shore, beaches and lands; it is my name: Clytemnestra! Aye aye world, here art Clytemnestra!” Her voice kicked into the speakers showing an ugly but sturdy ol’ PA system. She looked to Peon when the crowd gave no hoorah. He moved on. 

“I am Peon.” The crowd filled with energy and jumped up and down. To Nelson’s terror articles of clothing again began to drop, like flys, from the bodies of this wide swath of people. He pushed further to the edge, to the wall, to get away from the contact. The red paint seemed to be climbing up from the fallen dressings and invading the legs of each of these participants as the bodies and parts bounced. 

“Ne’er will I deal with such promiscuity well, ne’er, so where, where have I brought myself, a seducing place of becoming anything but the self, oh my oh my, so far from my type I lie.” He shuddered to the edge and reached up the wall and felt a gap. He pulled at the materials covering this discrepancy in the presumed partition. 

“We call out this evening for a volunteer.” Clytemnestra’s voice rose again. Just as she stated this he pulled on the material in his anxiety. It ripped from the wall and tipped toward the intimate mob. 

“You there!” She screamed as this panel fell completely and unveiled a window. 

“You there. You will volunteer!” She pointed with her crystal blade. Though just in this very second he saw, just has his mates had, the table outside surrounded by individuals also hoisting similarly glassy weapons, axes, picks and daggers. Nelson ran like a flagpole rippling with its draping wear back to whence he’d come. Again he contacted the room’s edge and ensnared his grippy digits along another panel. It too tipped like a sleeping steer and jostled the wad of humanity into even heavier pulsations. Nelson turned around with a heartbeat pounding like he’d chugged a quad shot espresso. 

“Come forth, come now,” she went on via PA stridently, not far from routined, as though the panels do this often. He stepped along the wall nearing her. She wasn’t looking in his direction as he obeyed her beckoning but at her fingernails and Peon, scratching his little head like a cat. Nelson had stepped up toward the front. Her eyes came back across the crowd to him. 

“Nelson?” She let out her surprise and drew the blade to his chin. 

“Nessie! I mean —Clytemnestra? It is indeed I, the one who is Nelson. Not a heathen nor heaven seeker nor even Son of Nel, nor sheep nor old goat. I am Nelson beginner of new things and finder of gentleness and tonight completer of questions.” Nelson paced back to the wall and pulled again to expose another window. No word came initially from her, Nessie gone Nestra, Clytemnestra, an encumbered character and personality left to fend for itself until the reach of the last light, a type that distributes its death equally until tired, a type that has already turned to the fire for answer and long left the phoney blinks of starlight. Nelson, too, tore his attention from the sexy mass.

“You are still tall just as I recall.” Nelson then stated. 

“Of course I’m still tall you fucking idiot!” Her. 

“You speak as though you have known one another for some time.” Peon observed.

“Nessie? Peon!? Nessie is my old housemate!” Nelson pointed at her.

“No, no. He’s going to ruin it!” Clytemnestra advocated. 

“Well, who are you, so quick with my name? You don’t know me!” Peon pried beyond her permittance. 

“This is some bullshit! Who’s here with you?” Clytemnestra interrogated.

“What is it then? What is this connection we have had since the moment I felt such a feeling nights ago? Wasn’t it you, the most cunning in this touching bunch, who left those fellows betrothed to piss amidst my work-station? And if not you who lended my friend a sheet of pukey paper to map out our cooperations? And most of all it must have been through you that I saw Courtney in our shared mind’s eye? And of course the great Buddha to Buddha communication? Tell us oh great one! Was it not unto me that you sailed such thoughts and premonitions?” Nelson tipped forward, disregarding the sword, as he presumed the answer to come with great seriousness.

“No. I am not you. What in worlds known do you speak of? I am better than you. And know not I,    And it ends there. Now—” Peon was derailed by Nessie sprinting off stage to another door, presumably toward the staircase leading to the front entrance.

“She goes.” Peon stated observantly. “But where?” He points to his wireless head set and the PA.

“What then of the armed group adjacent to the building?” Nelson continued. 

“Oh yes yes. It must all be of accordance then.”

“Open your sulfuric mouth hole wide enough for the truth to pour out you, you, you coward!”

“Oh wee mange of a man, are you perturbed to be stricken with her plague of suitorship as well? 

“Never you dastardly shabby procurer of futurology.” Nelson fumbles his license yet reaches on, “Dear reason! What then is that?  By whom we connect? You and that Clytemnestra?”

“Oh yes if you must paw, then I shall inform you, she came through to me some moons ago and we mated like the German and Latin languages did for centuries, like the floors of old growth forests we tore the sheets into a pure dust of what they were, yipping and yawing until they’re was nothing left but the truth and she stated to me what her lover and accomplice had done; it was a sacrifice not of spirit or trust but a material baby. It was her baby that he sacrificed to have their next move. ‘We will sell your Porsche. We sail to our future now on wind powered electric.’ She quoted him. The dreads developed from that neck of his and their flimsy pact disintegrated as foretold. ‘Don’t take my baby!’ She implored. ‘It’s not a baby.’ He tritely edited, and again I quote her quote. So, in short, we tore the sheets!”

“You disgust me!” Nelson quickly looked down. He looked back at the orgy. Other colors of paint had been introduced.

  

  

  

  

  

  

  

  

  

  

  

  

  

  

  

The Old Man  

  

They hopped in the bed while The Old Man circled round the front on over to the driver side. He opened it up and swung on in. The door shut. Windows, shut. 

“You called my father?”

“Let’s just get Nelson and get outta here. Okay!”

“Finally!” Clark did like Aggy and raised his hands in the air, “But The Old Man? Why in hell did you call my father? I don’t get it.” 

“Look, it was just an idea. Plus you found the contact for me. We needed a jump.”

“So you weren’t just unconscious, in the flatulence. And you stole Aggy’s beers?!”

“Just one. It’s simple.”

“What?”

“Ya do it when they ain’t looking.” Reggie nodded.

“One beer? Yeah right. Wait, so you just called him.”

“Clark.” Reggie, at the lapse of the right words, reached out for that beer to avoid. He shook the can. It was long gone. “Just—” Reggie then signaled with his empty hands for Clark to let up. “Look—” he stalled again. “Clark. I called him. But, your dad was here like this.” 

_Snap_

Reggie snapped quietly, “I called him, like, ten minutes ago.” Reggie pointed into the cabin. “And he’s already here.” He whispered the latter.

“I get it. But—” Clark suddenly too saw the goose pimples arise on his arm, and presumably his neck in its scrunching sensation. “What’s with that?” 

“Well, I don’t know! I didn’t get two sips into that beer though.” Reggie let out a big sigh as the old truck bumped up to the house and Rabbit.

“Maybe he’s the Alien.” 

“So you mean he could be here for—”

“—We don’t know. Technically.” Reggie filled. 

“Hand me that bag.” Clark called for the duffle bag strapped to the corner of the truck-bed. He pulled some jumper cables from under its burly zipper. They stepped out having reached the Rabbit as The Old Man turned round showing his wide and wise trek of a face with a little of everything packed in there. He smiled at the both of them. 

“It’s early.” He said firstly. The Old Man clutched the cables Clark seemed to enjoy passing as his mouth bolstered a practiced smile. Clark looked back to Reggie thinking of that peculiar slice of timeline they ought to address. He saw the pimples again, saw this time, before he felt. 

“Say Pa? I like your truck.” His hands swerved for pockets, “But uh—” The Old Man turned around. Suspicions of being called Pa remained in his eyes. 

“Ain’t it?” The Old Man let out an awkwardness as his reply lingered incompletely. 

“Uh, well, no need for being too weird, father—” His hands rose out of their place to the occasion, “Look, this is Aggy. Remember my old housemate?” Clark gestured competently. 

“Aye mighty what a pleasing!” Aggy propped himself up against the car. 

“However it is Agamemnon, please, call me Agamemnon.  And to whom do we befall our bizarre personal arrangements here?” The Old Man didn’t answer. He didn’t refuse. Nor did he obey. He was empty. Nor did Clark at first. He then looked at the revived Agamemnon. 

“What in hell?” Clark muttered disappointedly.

The Old Man took to the vehicle. He stretched the cables until they’d gripped the batteries nice and surely.  

“So, Father..” Clark went further feeling he’d have an ask eventually, 

“Do you know what this is?” Clark pointed up to the large manor. A window with violet light was exposed distracting Clark. 

“Oh shit it’s Nelson! Oh fuck, Reggie! Fuck! There he is!” 

“Let’s go!” Reggie charged. 

“Look Father, Look, we gotta go get our other friend. Just—just—”

“Stop swearing.” He stated and smiled again showing a sextet of decades compiled together, each more like itself than the other. 

  

  

_They ran over the hill._ 

_They went down to the table._ 

_It was clear they were not alone._ 

_Crystal weapons now lay across the table._ 

  

  

  

  

  

  

  

  

  

  

  

  

  

  

  

  

  

  

  

  

  

  

  

  

  

  

  

Sick of Being Sick 

  

  

“You disgust me.” Nelson repeated. 

He backed away from the stage and Peon and the door she ran through. Suddenly his armpits were met by Carbon’s hands. 

“Still fully dressed I see.” She said while absorbing his shocked affect with her layers of wear. 

“What the fuck Agamemnon!?”  Suddenly came over the PA. “Why are you back here? You left you miserable faux lover, frothing for nothing, coughing at no one!” A muffled voice deeper than hers said only a few words before the screaming blared through the amplifiers.

“AAUUGGFF!” 

“AAGGGCCK” 

“AAAAAAAAAAAAaaaaahh…….”

“Extraordinary.” Peon concluded then turned, “She’ll be back soon.”

“No!” said Carbon of the Highest Valence, “You’re not doing this to him!”

She clutched Nelson’s arm and went for the door Clytemnestra had escaped through. They ran. Nelson slowed his long legs, until, after the stairs they came out of the manor together, out into the field. The truck’s headlights were pointed at an open hood on the Rabbit with cables and two bodies slung over the grill. They let go of each other’s hands. At full bolt they ran to them. 

“Aggy and an old man have been assailed at the neck!” Nelson claimed.

Their blood spills while the Rabbit runs. Around the other corner came Reggie and Clark. Reggie carries a dagger-like crystal he pulled from the table of blades. Clark tugs on the hat as the alarm of the injured characters nearly flattens him. They reach Nelson and Carbon. 

“The Old Man!” Reggie cries out while ditching the dagger. 

They reach to pull their bodies out to the gravel. The Old Man still

breathes. Agamemnon’s heart does not pump. Clark tears at the hat, “No!”

“There!” Suddenly bugled from Carbon in surveying the hill. “She flees from us! Oh wait! No! She turns back!” The syndicate of illusory orators and fornicators had poured out into the field and wove their mass around in their direction. 

“Another one?” Reggie blurts. Another set of lights appeared from the tree line. Another car approaches at full speed. “Cassandra!” Reggie shouts out. 

“It’s Cassandra! The unbelievable Cassandra is here!” She drove into the lot in her stealthy pearl rod. 

She gets out, “Where is that Clytemnestra!?” She demands without acknowledging Reggie.

“Cassandra?” Reggie excites. A gargle erupted from The Old Man as the nexus of these tried actors formed, “She—" Clark bent down to his father’s side. 

The crystal, a shank of it, pressed into his clavicle. “She--” He coughed out, “—the hat.” Cassandra resumed the wheel in spotting Clytemnestra and pressed the accelerator, not gas. The legion of nudes, brave as they saw themselves stormed toward Cassandra, Reggie, Nelson, Carbon of the Highest Valence, Clark and The Old Man. She drove, her EV, chromey and status fulfilling right off the gravel and up the grass. The sunrise broke over the hill in that very instant she collided with the violent ménage, past and future, both willing, both unwilling, all here and now. Clytemnestra was eliminated. Peon too suffered his own squishing and vanquishing effect as Cassandra completed her pass. The rest with their animosity shuddered, twitched and wailed in a final demonic challenge, 

“How then,” The chorus of nudes cried, “Was being meant to be?” 

The Old Man sat up. He spat blood from his mouth. Carbon fastened a sling reddened in paint over his shoulder. He looked at the oddity merely letting his questions roll past. 

“Reggie.” Cassandra spoke as she sorely moved away from the car, “It happened. Clytemnestra. Happened.” She stepped the rest of the yard back into the group. “I didn’t want it to but—“

“No Cassandra! You found us! You’ve saved us beautiful Cassandra!”

“You boy. Oh Reggie you’ll never believe. Since you left I’ve had these incredible and foretelling dreams. I was about to lose it when it dawned on me. And I knew what I had to do. So here I am. Taking out the bad girl. But--”

“Wait, you really saw this whole thing? And in a dream?” Reggie followed. The blood continued to glug out of dead Agamemnon. Nelson showed Carbon to the back seat of the Rabbit. Cassandra led Reginald into her fancy whip. Though not without a few pugnacious and opened handed swings. And a very lucky Reggie resounding from afar, “I think it’s time for Buddha to Buddha communication.” 

As he whistled some notes to his friend. It was now Clark and The Old Man on the field, 

“Well, maybe it’s about time to put a sunrise on that pretty no perspective of yours And uh.” Sun light then sped across the field to reach them.

“And grow your life a little?” He was looking at him now. “I love you.” Gave The Old Man. It was Clark’s turn. 

“I love you too.”

  

And wouldn’t ya know,

Yes words, ideas and images, 

Yes a history of minds teeming with sympathy,

And yes wind, a morning wind took that hat right off good Clark’s big head.

  

  

  

  

  

  

  

  

  

  

  

  

  

_Extra Special Appreciation_

  

I am and will always be gratefully indebted to Tony. I am also so thankful for the efforts of wonderful friends and family to bring this at least a first portion of this saga to a close, at last.
