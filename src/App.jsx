      Island Roofing and Remodel - Roofer - 7/2023 - current <br /> <br />  
      This job requires a lot of heavy lifting and climbing. It is entirely outdoors and requires a great amount of willingness to succeed in roofing homes in rougher weather. we use power tools e.g. saws, drills, metal shears. We also use air power nail guns and staplers. To be successful as a roofer one must be sharp with problem solving skills. This is needed for complex tasks to roof-in the home but also to keep oneself safe on slippery roofs in the rain. A roofer must also be familiar with safety requirements in various types of jobs. This job also required enough dedication for us to purchase most of our own tools.

      Ghost City Tours - Licensed Tour Guide (NOLA) 3/2023 - 7/2023
        <br /> <br />
        In the city of New Orleans this survives one of richest concentrations of american history. Though truly the history is spread throughout the entire city however the french quarter is particularly fit to tour upon one's visit. People have been visiting this city for over 300 years! I was able be earn my license as a tour guide as well as pass a few tests for the Ghost City Tours company to make a living as a tour guide. The job is tremendous! It does require a lot of detail orientation and memorization of dates, names and truly wonderful stories. Its the job of the tour guide to show excellent hospitality skills and negotiate ( at time hectic ) parts of the French Quarter with up to 28 people!

Pagliacci’s Pizza – Delivery Driver 10/2020 - 9/2021
  <br /><br />
  Delivery drivers are needed to be accurate with very minute details, that is, the toppings! we were required to check every pizza and follow (at times tricky) directions upon delivery. This job was very fast paced though with minimal hours.

  <br /><br />
  Jack of Jack's BBQ hired me as prep cook and line cook and later I became one of the slicers as well. After about 6 months the new location in SLU opened and they gave me a chance to write a brunch menu. A few weeks in we opened BBQ brunch @ Jack's. It was great! Unfortunately they dropped the whole program when we hit the pandemic.
