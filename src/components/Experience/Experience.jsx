        <h3>Island Roofing and Remodel - Roofer (Coupeville) 7/2023 - 5/2024 </h3> 
        This job requires a lot of heavy lifting and climbing. It was entirely outdoors and requires a great amount of willingness to succeed despite rougher weather. We use power tools e.g. saws, drills, metal shears. We also use air power nail guns and staplers. To be successful as a roofer one must be sharp with problem solving skills. This is needed for complex tasks to roof-in the home but also to keep oneself safe on slippery roofs in the rain. A roofer must also be familiar with safety requirements in various types of jobs. This job also required committment to purchase most of our own tools.

      <h3>Ghost City Tours - Licensed Tour Guide (NOLA) 3/2023 - 7/2023</h3>
        At the heart of New Orleans survives one of richest concentrations of American history. The French Quarter! Although it is true the history is spread throughout the entire city, the french quarter boasts hundreds of historical buildings some over 250 years old. I was able be earn my license as a tour guide by passing a few tests for about the city and was hired by Ghost City Tours. The job is tremendous! It requires a lot of detail orientation and memorization of dates, names and stories. It is also the job of the tour guide to show excellent hospitality skills while navigating through ( at times hectic ) parts of the French Quarter with up to 28 people!

      <h3>Pagliacci’s Pizza – Delivery Driver (Seattle) 10/2020 - 9/2021</h3>
      Delivery drivers must be accurate with very minute details, that is, the toppings! We were required to check every pizza and follow (at times tricky) directions upon delivery. This job was very fast paced though with minimal hours.

      <h3>Jack’s BBQ – Prep Cook, Line Cook, Brunch Chef (Seattle) 10/2019 - 5/2020</h3>
    
      Jack of Jack's BBQ hired me as prep cook and line cook and later I became one of the chefs as well. After about 6 months the new location in SLU opened and they gave me a chance to write a brunch menu. A few weeks later we opened BBQ brunch @ Jack's SLU. It was great! Unfortunately they dropped the whole program when we hit the pandemic after which I decided to move on from BBQ.
