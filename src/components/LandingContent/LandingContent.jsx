        <h3>Who the heck are you?</h3>
        <br /><br />
        The past few years have been very exciting! I may at least be able to say that regarding the chance I've had to learn how to program. The pandemic caused a great deal of misfortune directly and indirectly through the world. It could also be said that the destructive effect of the pandemic was distributed unexpectedly and surely without fairness. Without entering the subject entirely, its evident there were those who were hurt more by the pandemic. 
        <br /><br />
        Necessity is a mother. Our ability to gather together and rise to great adversity is simultaneously beautiful and excruciating. One of those stories in trying to rise to the occasion was that of the restaurant industry in 2020. At the point of the pandemic the restaurant industry had grown substantially over the past ten years. (what are the numbers here?) as evidenced by visible development of new dining locations but also in the cycle of major media highlighting certain personalities (i.e. Bourdain, Ray, Lagassi). Along with bigger bucks coming to the table, off-shoots of restaurant growth bloomed. Ubers Eats, Door Dash and the like were success in incorporating food with light speed technologies. There is substantive reporting about how this field was in fact out-doing the 'dining-in' restaurant experience. The smart-phone made it possible for a more distant social experience to come into our lives, minimal to zero contact with the 'outside world' as a direct consequence of this power at our finger-tips, a new found finger food? The demand for such systems in smaller restaurants grew. These apps grew into the restaurants like a grid of mycelium nodules making room for themselves on plastic side-tables and bombarding front of house with enough chargers cables and iPads to run their own start-up. And, to no surprise, it came with fees. The system was complex and expensive for restaurants.

        The distancing was set to scale up, it was enabled by tech however the pandemic mandated this dissipation. We are indeed stronger when in reach of one another. It is fact that were survive via interdependence. Nevertheless the times called for austerity, and every step forward was unprecedented (including the over-use of certain words like unprecedented). I was laid-off, kindly, I should say. My boss at the time had to call 40+ people to inform them of the matter. Must have been strange, even with most of us expecting it at the time.
